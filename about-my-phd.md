My thesis is [<cite>The Public Perceptions and Personal Experiences of Only Children Growing Up in Britain, c. 1850-1950</cite>](https://repository.essex.ac.uk/22943/) and took just under five years, which was two years longer than planned. The first three years were suspiciously easy, the unexpected fourth year was not, and I spent most of the fifth year waiting for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn.

I've published some of my findings in [<cite>The Routledge History of Loneliness</cite>](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780429331848-21) (2023) and ['The history of loneliness: what we know so far' (WHO BCI Hub report)](https://bci-hub.org/documents/history-loneliness-what-we-know-so-far) (2024).
