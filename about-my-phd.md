My thesis is [<cite>The Public Perceptions and Personal Experiences of Only Children Growing Up in Britain, c. 1850-1950</cite>](https://repository.essex.ac.uk/22943/) and took just under five years, which was two years longer than planned. The first three years were suspiciously easy, the unexpected fourth year was not, and I spent most of the fifth year waiting for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn.
