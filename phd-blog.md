My thesis is [<cite>The Public Perceptions and Personal Experiences of Only Children Growing Up in Britain, c. 1850-1950</cite>](http://repository.essex.ac.uk/22943/) and took just under five years, which was two years longer than planned. The first three years were suspiciously easy, the unexpected fourth year was not, and I spent most of the fifth year waiting for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn.

If you go back past all the book posts on my blog, you can see rough-around-the-edges versions of the blog posts I wrote during my PhD. I'm probably never going to get around to sorting out their metadata and images over on this site, but you can still see the originals at <a href="https://aliceinacademia.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">aliceinacademia.tumblr.com</a>.
