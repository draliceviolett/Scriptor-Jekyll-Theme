My thesis is [<cite>The Public Perceptions and Personal Experience of Only Children, c. 1850-1950</cite>](http://repository.essex.ac.uk/22943/) and took just under five years, which was two years longer than planned. The first three years were suspiciously easy, the unexpected fourth year was not, and I spent most of the fifth year waiting for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn.

I'm very slowly cleaning up [my old posts](https://aliceinacademia.tumblr.com) so that they show up properly on [my 'forever' blog](/) (it's happening so slowly because it's an incredibly tedious task). I'm weeding out unnecessary images (mostly because I can't be bothered to copy *everything* into my images folder) and reblogs (don't really work as a concept outside of Tumblr).
