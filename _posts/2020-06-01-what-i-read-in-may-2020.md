I actually read more in May than I would normally, including a whopping century-spanning Russian-adjacent novel of 1,244 (tablet) pages (the magnificent <cite>The Eighth Life</cite>, by Nino Haratischwili) in just four days! Lots of other 4.5 and 5* books, too. I posted six book reviews, with even more to come in June.

![Exit Wounds, Cold Crash, Shiver, Orphan Monster Spy, The Glass House](/images/may-2020-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>Exit Wounds</cite>, by Paul B. Kane & Marie O'Regan (eds.) - 4*

<cite>Cold Crash</cite>, by Jennifer Young - 4.5*

<cite>Shiver</cite>, by Maggie Stiefvater - 4*

<cite>Orphan Monster Spy</cite>, by Matt Killeen. YA at its best: an exciting story that gets across historical realities (well, maybe the plot is a *little* far-fetched) and makes you think about the 'banality of evil' - 4.5*

[<cite>The Glass House</cite>, by Eve Chase](/the-glass-house-by-eve-chase/) - 5*

![The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt, Injections of Insanity, The Light Fantastic, The Tempus Project, The Mysterious Affair at Styles](/images/may-2020-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt</cite>, by Sarah Armstrong - 4*

<cite>Injections of Insanity</cite>, by Lorraine Mace - 4*

<cite>The Light Fantastic</cite>, by Terry Pratchett - 4*

[<cite>The Tempus Project</cite>, by Antony Johnston](/blog-tour-the-tempus-project/) - 5*

<cite>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</cite>, by Agatha Christie - 4*

![The Eighth Life, Her Body and Other Parties, The Cat and the City, The Ghost Tree, Devil Darling Spy](/images/may-2020-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>The Eighth Life</cite>, by Nino Haratischwili. Epic, riveting, unforgettable - 5*

<cite>Her Body and Other Parties</cite>, by Carmen Maria Machado. As with all short story collections, I loved some and didn't 'get' others. My favourite was 'Especially Heinous', which made me think of [Dread Singles](https://twitter.com/hottestsingles), [Ministry of Sleep](https://twitter.com/MIN_OF_SLEEP), [Fossilized Tree Resin](https://twitter.com/Jamberee13) and their ilk - 4*

[<cite>The Cat and the City</cite>, by Nick Bradley](/the-cat-and-the-city-by-nick-bradley/) - 3.5*

[<cite>The Ghost Tree</cite>, by M. R. C. Kasasian](/the-ghost-tree-by-m-r-c-kasasian/) - 5*

<cite>Devil Darling Spy</cite>, by Matt Killeen - 3.5*

![A Luminous Republic, The Van Apfel Girls Are Gone, Remain Silent](/images/may-2020-collage-4.jpg)

[<cite>A Luminous Republic</cite>, by Andr√©s Barba](/a-luminous-republic-by-andres-barba/) - 4*

<cite>The Van Apfel Girls Are Gone</cite>, by Felicity McLean. Review coming soon - 4.5*

<cite>Remain Silent</cite>, by Susie Steiner. Another great, timely literary thriller and I LOVE Manon, though I think she needs to check her privilege sometimes - 4.5*

## Looking ahead...

![A Cosmology of Monsters, The Golden Notebook, The Exphoria Code, The Miseducation of Evie Epworth, Daughters of Fire](/images/may-2020-collage-5.jpg)

Even though I read a whopping 18 books this month, my TBR pile never gets any smaller, not least because I keep making Netgalley requests and joining blog tours!

Doris Lessing's <cite>The Golden Notebook</cite> has been on my pile for ages - I got it with November's [Books That Matter](https://www.booksthatmatter.co.uk/) box along with a load of awesome stationery. I haven't read any Barbara Erskine in a couple of months even though I love her books, so that needs to be rectified with <cite>Daughters of Fire</cite>. [<cite>The Tempus Project</cite>, by Antony Johnston](/blog-tour-the-tempus-project/) was one of the best books I read in May, so it would be remiss of me not to read the previous book in the series, <cite>The Exphoria Code</cite>.

I'm on the blog tour for Matson Taylor's <cite>The Miseducation of Evie Epworth</cite>, which looks to be an amusing coming-of-age story - and I got to have the advance copy in paperback! I requested <cite>A Cosmology of Monsters</cite>, by Shaun Hamill from Netgalley, meanwhile, because it looks amazingly creepy.
