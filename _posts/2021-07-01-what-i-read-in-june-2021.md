Another challenging month, as my brain continues to fire crap at itself. I read ten books, which is less than I usually read, but still good! Seven of them were for tours, so I've had lots of review-writing to keep me busy, at least.

## Looking ahead...

This month I'm planning to read the new releases from three of my go-to crime authors - Mark Billingham, Mel Sherratt, and Doug Johnstone. Having enjoyed my first Will Carver book, <cite>The Beresford</cite>, for a blog tour, I also intend to read the copy of <cite>Good Samaritans</cite> that's been sitting on my Kindle for an embarrassingly long time.

I didn't get round to reading the Lucinda Riley's <cite>The Missing Sister</cite> as planned last month, so I'm going to try to get to it this month. I was so sad to read about her death from cancer shortly after this final instalment in a series I love was published.
