April was a long and quite weird month for me - my mental health really nosedived, but I still read lots of books, and they did make me feel comforted/at least distracted for a bit.

Writing reviews also helped, as doing it reminds me that there is more to me than what's going on in my head, and it feels good to make authors feel appreciated and hopefully give their books a bit of promotion.

## Looking ahead...

Got a few more blog tours in May! I'm particularly looking forward to <cite>A Wild and Precious Life</cite>, edited by Lily Dunn and Zoe Gilbert. It's an anthology of stories of recovering from various circumstances including mental health issues, and it looks like it will be relateable, comforting and inspiring.

<cite>Everything Happens for a Reason</cite>, by Katie Allen, has a really intriguing premise while, if [<cite>Silent Graves</cite>](/blog-tour-silent-graves/) and [<cite>Kill Shot</cite>](/blog-tour-kill-shot/) are anything to go by, I'm going to like <cite>Web of Lies</cite>, by Sally Rigby.

<cite>The Starlings of Bucharest</cite>, by Sarah Armstrong, is my pick for May's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) - this month's theme is 'a book in a series' so it fits the bill nicely there, but I also want to read it because I enjoyed <cite>The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt</cite> and I know Sarah from my writing group! I went to [Red Lion Books](https://www.redlionbooks.co.uk/)' online launch and it was so interesting to hear all about her new book.
