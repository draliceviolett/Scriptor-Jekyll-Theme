In May, I read ten books, which is slightly less than usual for me (I know, I know). I did, however, read widely, taking in historical fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, and non-fiction.

Writing did not end up happening at Orford Ness this time, alas, but I have been practising reading out the story that came out of my previous trip for [Emotional Madness on 5 June](https://colchesterartscentre.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173658327/events/428675492).

Another month of reading adventures beckons... I've been wanting to pick up <cite>This Is How You Lose the Time War</cite>, by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone for ages, and this month I should finally get to it \<mumbles>because it's 99p on Kindle\</mumbles>. I've had Becky Chambers' Monk and Robot omnibus on pre-order since February and can't wait for it to finally come through the door!

I've just started <cite>Named: A Story of Names and Reclaiming Who We Are</cite>, by Camilla Balshaw, and I can already tell that a) it's exactly the type of non-fiction I get really into, and b) I'm not going to struggle for things to say about it in my blog tour review. You have been warned!
