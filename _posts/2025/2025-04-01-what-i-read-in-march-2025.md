March was good to me. As well as reading 12 books, I stayed with a couple of old friends for a few days (and came home with *slightly* more books than I left with...), went to this quarter's Emotional Madness ([my triumphant(?) return to the stage is in June](https://colchesterartscentre.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173658327/events/428675492)), and caught up on a ton of TV I'd been meaning to watch, on top of the standard excessive board-gaming.

![In a Place of Darkness, A Sunny Place for Shady People, We Who Hunt Alexanders, I'll Never Be Young Again](/images/march-2025-collage-4.jpg)

Hoping to get some extra reading in over the Easter break this month, but we'll see...

I'm already halfway through <cite>In a Place of Darkness</cite>, by Stuart MacBride, and looking forward to the rest of it!

<cite>A Sunny Place for Shady People</cite>, by Mariana Enriquez and translated by Megan McDowell, and <cite>I'll Never Be Young Again</cite>, by Daphne Du Maurier, are a couple of the books I picked up on my travels last month that I want to get to sooner rather than later.

Having enjoyed other work of his, I'm also particularly excited to read <cite>We Who Hunt Alexanders</cite> by Jason Sanford this month.
