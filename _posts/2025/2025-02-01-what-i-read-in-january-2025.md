January was another month that seemed to go on forever, without the benefit of a pleasant break at the end (or much pleasant at all, really *\*glares in approximate direction of the U.S.*\*).

One good thing (other than reading) was a trip out to Orford Ness as part of the [Beach of Dreams project](https://www.beachofdreams.org/). It was a stunning sunny winter's day and we heard some fascinating things about the Ness' history. There was a writing activity after we walked around the island, and I actually feel motivated and inspired to develop what I came up with, which makes a change.

I took lots of pictures on the day, which you can see in [my Mastodon thread about Orford Ness](https://ohai.social/@alicemcalicepants/113888048373760826) (no login required).

Anyway, books.

<cite>The Autistic Brain</cite>, by Temple Grandin and Richard Panek - interesting stuff, but too much generalisation, and don't get me started on the whole 'young autistics these days are work-shy and should mask their traits to get and keep jobs, as that's the only way to contribute to society' thing. 3*

## Looking ahead...

![An Orchid in my Belly Button, Record of a Spaceborn Few, The Mune](/images/january-2025-collage-4.jpg)

Through my writing group, I'm privileged to know some people who are doing really cool things. This month, two such writers have books out that I'm reading for review &ndash; I'm on the blog tour for Katy Wimhurst's <cite>An Orchid in my Belly Button</cite>, and am reviewing <cite>The Mune</cite>, by Sue Dawes, at the author's request. So exciting!

In the meantime, I've started <cite>Record of a Spaceborn Few</cite>, by Becky Chambers, and so far I'm enjoying it as much as expected (i.e. a lot).
