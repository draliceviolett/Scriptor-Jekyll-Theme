<cite>Desolation: Keep Your Imaginary Friends Close</cite>, by D. Harrigon, picks up two months on from the events of [<cite>Desolation: The Overdue Library</cite>](/desolation-the-overdue-library-by-d-harrigon/). Hetch is, so far, managing to avoid being recognised as the infiltrator of Muha-Maho Palace, while working with Vee, Pearson, and other allies to skim salvaged materials and supplies to fit out a technologically-advanced boat ("Bilbo") for their planned expedition to Landing Site One &ndash; the true location of which Hetch discovered in the previous instalment.

Of course, plenty of obstacles come up: a particularly vicious crab takes Pearson's steam engine out of action; Hetch has to deal with being pulled in for a regional identity parade, as well as the hostility of Aqualina, the contender she reluctantly took down in a fight at the palace; and a trio of false friends steal a cutter containing metal and flour Hetch and co. desperately need for their mission.

Then Captain Galetea, unaware of Bilbo's true purpose, makes an offer the gang can't refuse: she'll supply everything they need to complete the boat in record time, in return for them pursuing the rebel Daughters of the Iron Drum who have not only taken our heroes' goods, but a precious man from the huts at Muha-Maho.

Along the way, we meet Daughters Nzinga, Organa, and Inari as they sneakily join a salvage mission, commandeer the loaded cutter &ndash; and end up in mortal danger when the man they've kidnapped fights back in ways that are surprising to say the least.
