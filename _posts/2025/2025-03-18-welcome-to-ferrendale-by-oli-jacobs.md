**I received a free copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.**

> 'A fortunate crash allows three criminals to make their escape into the nearby woods. They consist of: Taggart, a man with big ambitions and an ego to match; Frank, an old career criminal interested in dark knowledge; and Simon, a meek fraudster convicted of manslaughter.

> 'Taking Taggart's lead, the trio end up laying low in the isolated seaside village of Ferrendale, where old traditions threaten to make their stay more dangerous than they imagined.'

In <cite>Welcome to Ferrendale</cite>, by Oli Jacobs, three very different convicts &ndash; Frank, Taggart, and Simon &ndash; find themselves unexpectedly at liberty when the van transferring them between prisons crashes. They head for the nearest settlement, which turns out to be the sleepy coastal village of Ferrendale.

The trio soon discover they've arrived just in time for the annual flooding that cuts the village off from the mainland, and the associated local Sea Festival. While Simon is laid low by sickness and nightmares, Frank takes the opportunity to learn about the area's unique history and traditions, and Taggart becomes popular with the villagers &ndash; but is their enthusiasm for him quite what it seems?
