February went at a far more tolerable pace than January did. Currently, it feels like I'm either very busy, or completely exhausted from being busy &ndash; there is no in between!

I actually completed a short story based on what I came up with on my day out on Orford Ness in January. Whether that's it writing-wise for 2025 remains to be seen...

## Looking ahead...

I keep saying I'm 'entering my mushroom era', because I'm currently attracted to things with mushroom designs on them, so it made sense to read <cite>Entangled Life: how fungi make our worlds, change our minds, and shape our futures</cite>, and it's absolutely fascinating so far.

I really enjoyed [<cite>The Flames</cite>, by Sophie Hay](/blog-tour-the-flames/), so I'm looking forward to reading her new novel, <cite>Madame Matisse</cite>, for the blog tour this month.

My Becky Chambers journey will also continue, with <cite>The Galaxy and the Ground Within</cite>.
