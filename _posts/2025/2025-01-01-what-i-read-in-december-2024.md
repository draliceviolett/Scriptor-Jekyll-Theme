December felt like a *really* long month. For the first three weeks, it was all obligations, appointments, and events, ranging from the torturous to the jolly good fun. Then it was the Christmas break, which I've mostly spent reading, playing board games, drafting a few of my January blog posts, and maintaining something resembling a gym habit. It's been like microdosing the retirement I'll probably never attain.

I'm so in love with Becky Chambers' books at the moment! Having just read <cite>The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet</cite>, I'm looking forward to continuing the Wayfarers series with <cite>A Closed and Common Orbit</cite>.

My post-Christmas shopping was remarkably restrained this year. Two books I bought were <cite>Cursed Under London</cite>, by Gabby Hutchinson Crouch, having loved her Rooks series, and <cite>Orbital</cite>, by Samantha Harvey &ndash; its Booker Prize win brought it to my attention, but it sounds like just the sort of thing I'm into at the moment: uplifting sci-fi that's full of wonder.
