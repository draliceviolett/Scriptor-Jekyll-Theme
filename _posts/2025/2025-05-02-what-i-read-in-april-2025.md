April felt particularly bookish, even by my standards. As well as gorging myself on books and penning (keyboarding?) a handful of reviews as usual, I went to three book events &ndash; two for [<cite>The Mune</cite>](/the-mune-by-sue-dawes/) by my talented friend Sue Dawes, and one with Natasha Pulley and Claire North, where they spoke really engagingly about Greek myth reimaginings.

This month, I'm off to Orford Ness again, where I'm hoping inspiration for a completed story will strike a second time! You can hear me read (most of) the first one at [Emotional Madness in June](https://colchesterartscentre.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173658327/events/428675492).

Feeling inspired by my last three reads of April, which all featured transformation in one way or another, I've started <cite>The Fox Wife</cite>, by Yangsze Choo, and I'm really enjoying it so far.

I picked up <cite>Ithaca</cite>, by Claire North, at her event with Natasha Pulley last month. I've really dropped the ball on both Greek reimaginings and North in recent \<mumbles> years \</mumbles>, but the event was so entertaining, I feel compelled to rectify that!

May itself is looking quiet for me on the blogging front, but I'll be using the time to get on top of some of my reviews for June. <cite>The Original Daughter</cite>, by Jemimah Wei, is an upcoming blog tour book I particularly like the sound of!
