## The book

> 'London, late 1990s. Stan, a young and promising French composer, is invited to arrange the music for a theatrical adaptation of <cite>The Picture of Dorian Gray</cite>. The play will never be staged, but Stan meets Liv, the love of his life, and their harmonious duo soon becomes a trio with the birth of their beloved daughter, Lisa. Stan’s world is filled with vibrant colour and melodic music, and under his wife and daughter’s gaze, his piano comes to life.

> 'Paris, today. After Liv’s fatal accident, Stan returns to France surrounded by darkness, no longer able to compose, and living in the Rabbit Hole, a home left to him by an aunt. He shares his life with Babette, a lifeguard and mother of a boy of Lisa’s age, and Laïvely, an AI machine of his own invention endowed with Liv’s voice, which he spent entire nights building after her death.

> 'But Stan remains haunted by his past. As the silence gradually gives way to noises, whistles and sighs &ndash; sometimes even a burst of laughter &ndash; and Laïvely seems to take on a life of its own, memories and reality fade and blur...

> 'And Stan’s new family implodes...'
