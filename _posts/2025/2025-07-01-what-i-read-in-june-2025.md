I can't complain about June (apart from the heat &ndash; roll on autumn!). As usual, I read a whole bunch of books. I also drafted, and re-drafted, enough of a short story that I feel compelled to polish it off. Big thanks to my mini Zoom writing group for keeping on at me to continue working on it after the session (which is always a stumbling block for me), and giving invaluable feedback.

My review schedule is looking rather sparse beyond the next couple of weeks, so if you want a book reviewed soonish, now's a good time to ask! Feel free to contact me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/alicemcalicepants/) or [Mastodon](https://ohai.social/@alicemcalicepants/). I especially enjoy reviewing autobiogaphy, other non-fiction, short stories, and sci-fi.

Lots of blue/blue-adjacent book covers this month! A new Eva Björg Ægisdóttir blog tour is always a must-jump-on for me, so I'm looking forward to <cite>Home Before Dark</cite>.

Reading <cite>The Forty Rules of Love</cite> last month reminded me that I love Elif Shafak's writing, and <cite>The Island of Missing Trees</cite> was already on my TBR pile, so that's a no-brainer. I'll also be continuing Claire North's Penelope series with <cite>House of Odysseus</cite>.

I'm about to start <cite>Guilty by Definition</cite>, by Susie Dent, which comes very highly recommended by my dad!
