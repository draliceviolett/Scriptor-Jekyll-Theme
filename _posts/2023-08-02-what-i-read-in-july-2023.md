In July, I read 11 books (might've been more if one hadn't been a humungous Stephen King book!) and did very little creative writing.

However, I do very much need to get my writing arse into gear, as the next [Emotional Madness](https://www.colchesterartscentre.com/events/performance/emotional-madness-with-maryann-mates-3/) is on 29 August. Luckily, I know roughly what I want to write, and I'm still buzzing from the Primadonna Festival last weekend.

I had a brilliant time &ndash; better than last year, because 1) I didn't have toothache; and 2) I had a better idea of what to expect, including what camping would be like, so I felt more chilled-out.

My personal highlights were:

* The evening performances from Brigitte Aphrodite, Brenda Read Brown, and Cally Beaton.
* Sheela Banerjee and Pretti Dhillon talking about their amazing-sounding new history books.
* Polly Crosby, Leone Ross, and Maryam Ebrahim talking about writing with chronic illness and disability.
* Polly Crosby's historical fiction masterclass (I wrote something! And read it out to the class!).
* Going for a walk in the woods and seeing animals (both live and model) with my friend Olga (not pictured below).

All in all, I had a very inspiring and memorable weekend.

I did feel a twinge of 'that could have been me on the stage, if carrying on in academia had been a viable option/I'd stayed as committed to writing as I was before the age of 11/I could bear uncertainty and instability'. At least I have a platform with Emotional Madness :) 

Anyway, books!

![Do Not Go Quietly, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, Vita and the Birds, The Lost Archive, Raising Demons](/images/july-2023-collage-4.jpg)

Feeling especially pumped up about this month's reading &ndash; possibly another festival after-effect!

As I particularly enjoyed not just one, but two Primadonna sessions with Polly Crosby, it would be remiss of me not to actually read one of her books (plus, <cite>Vita and the Birds</cite> sounds fantastic!).

I picked up <cite>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</cite>, by Gabrielle Zevin, because it was in a 'buy one get one half price' promotion, and there's been so much positive hype about it, I want to see what I think.

On the short story side, I'll be reading <cite>Do Not Go Quietly</cite>, edited by Lesley Conner and Jason Sizemore, and <cite>The Lost Archive</cite>, by Lynn C. Miller, for review. I've ordered <cite>Raising Demons</cite>, by Shirley Jackson, because I loved <cite>Life Among the Savages</cite> so much.
