After the longest January on record, February seemed to fly by! I read 12 books, and failed to watch any serieseseseses.

Writing-wise, on the surface, February didn't *look* as productive as [January](/what-i-read-in-january-2023/) because I didn't finish anything - but I wrote c. 3,500 words of a max. 5,000-word short story due for a competition on 6 March, which is slightly more than the two stories I completed in January combined. I don't believe it's my best work, but it still feels good that I produced *something*. Now I need to write the rest of it. In three days.

Also, [<cite>The Routledge History of Loneliness</cite>](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9780429331848/routledge-history-loneliness-katie-barclay-elaine-chalus-deborah-simonton) came out this month! I don't expect anyone to buy it because it is £££££, but having been approached to contribute to it in 2019, and written the first draft of my chapter in 2020, it was really nice to finally have it in my hands.

## Looking ahead...

![Pachinko, Reaper Man, The Rules of the Road](/images/february-2023-collage-4.jpg)

I'm light-ish on the tours in March, so I'm mostly planning to pick from my TBR as my mood takes me. But I will be continuing to work my way through the Discworld Death novels.

<cite>Pachinko</cite>, by Min Jin Lee, has been on my wishlist for ages, as it sounds right up my street, and I got it for £1.99 the other day, so I'm looking forward to finally getting to read it.

I picked up <cite>The Rules of the Road</cite> by C. B. Jones after enjoying reading a short story of his in an anthology, and I'm really intrigued by the blurb!
