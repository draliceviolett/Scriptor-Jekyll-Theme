In <cite>Lesser Known Monsters</cite>, by Rory Michaelson, we meet bumbling, unassuming Oscar and his friends and hospital colleagues Zara and Marcus.

An encounter with what appears to be a wounded child leads them to discover a whole world of creatures they previously had no idea of - and it's down to them to save humanity from the less pleasant ones.

I found <cite>Lesser Known Monsters</cite> an entertaining, imaginative read. I was intrigued by the different beasts that popped up throughout the book, with the occasional 'Taxonomy of Monsters' interludes giving it great folk horror vibes.

The setting, though, is strictly urban, thanks to Michaelson's vivid, atmospheric descriptions of locations in London. I especially appreciated his portrayal of the creepy, dilapidated Victorian house where Dmitri is based, and the scenes that took place in a cemetery.

I really liked Oscar - he has a lot of shortcomings, which he's highly aware of, but he more than makes up for these with his sweet and caring nature. His interactions with Zara and Marcus are often a hoot, and his budding relationship with Dmitri is lovely.

I also liked the more benevolent fantastical creatures who make an appearance, namely Gax and the Bean-Nighe, who are full of character and put me in mind of <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite> and <cite>Labyrinth</cite>.

What's more, the story is fast-paced, with action, danger, and surprises at every turn. 

<cite>Lesser Known Monsters</cite> is imaginative and action-packed, with a likeable main character.
