> 'Being the chosen one isn’t always a good thing...

> 'Oscar Tundale is not a hero. Anxious, indecisive, and awkward, he can barely get through a normal day. Now he’s about to find out monsters are real.

> 'Oscar's friends: brave, stubborn Zara, and hyperactive, paranoid Marcus, might help discover what hunts him, and unravel the truth about the handsome doctor he pines for.

> 'But only heroes can save the world, so maybe the best Oscar can hope for is to not end it by accident.'
