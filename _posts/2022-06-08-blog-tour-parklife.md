**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

> "It’s 1996. Emma’s been rejected by the man she loves and sacked from the job she hates. Feeling like she’s hit a new low, she finds herself serving ice-cream and phoney smiles at the park.

> "Best mate Dave’s loved up, and her dad’s finally emerging from years of unemployment. Everyone’s life is on the up while Emma’s plummeting towards rock bottom.

> "Every day she gives a free 99 to the lonely old man who sits on the park bench and reminds herself that life could be much worse.

> "But soon, even sprinkles and monkey’s blood can’t hide the truth. She’s in deep trouble and losing sight of the edge. Who will help her up when she falls?"

In <cite>Parklife</cite>, by Lucy Nichol, we're reunited with Emma, Dave, and other characters from [<cite>The Twenty Seven Club</cite>](/blog-tour-the-twenty-seven-club/), two years later.

Things seem to be going well for everyone but Emma - the book begins with her being dumped by boyfriend John, and sacked from her boring-but-dependable job ordering bathroom supplies for caravans.

Living in surrogate nan Dor's spare room, and working in an ice-cream hut in a park, Emma's legendary fondness for a drink tips over into addiction and danger. Will her loved ones be able to get through to her in time?

<cite>The Twenty Seven Club</cite> was one of [my favourite books of 2021](/best-of-2021/), so I was very keen to get on the blog tour for <cite>Parklife</cite>. While the sequel is darker in tone, it features the familiar 90s setting and humorous observations and conversations that I loved in its predecessor.

Emma's endearing, funny voice is still there too, but what makes this story so heart-breaking is that it comes under threat as she becomes unable to get through the day without a drink, and has blackouts where she acts in selfish, destructive, and out-of-character ways. I felt so sad and like I was losing her more and more whenever she did something she'd resolved not to.

<cite>Parklife</cite> does work as a standalone, but I think reading <cite>The Twenty Seven Club</cite> first will give you a better understanding of the brilliant character Emma is normally, and therefore exactly what's at stake here. You'll also get a clearer idea of what happened to her mum, which explains why Emma is the way she is.

In Emma's increasing 'absence', other characters step up to the plate and remind you that there is some good in the world. While Emma's behaviour can be frustrating, hurtful, and frightening, Dor, her dad Tel, and best friend Dave know it's not who she really is. They refuse to give up on her, while being aware that there's only so much they can do until she's willing to help herself.

I enjoyed seeing more of Dor, an entertaining character who puts me in mind of Big Mo from EastEnders. Emma also strikes up a lovely friendship with Les, a recovering older alcoholic who frequents the park and is a continual source of wisdom.

While I've never suffered from addiction, like Emma I've had times where I've felt that everyone was doing well in life except me, woken up dreading the day ahead, and hidden the extent of my problems to avoid upsetting or inconveniencing people. I've had times where I've felt like the funny, enthusiastic person I am in good times is gone forever.

Also like Emma, I've previously lost sight of the fact that the people who really care about you won't desert, judge, or hate you forever the minute you mess up, let them down, or show any signs of imperfection, and have felt buoyed up by spending time with people who are open about being messy and flawed themselves. This is therefore a very relatable book with a positive message at its heart.

<cite>Parklife</cite> is a heart-breaking and heart-warming story of addiction, friendship, and being good to one another as fellow humans.
