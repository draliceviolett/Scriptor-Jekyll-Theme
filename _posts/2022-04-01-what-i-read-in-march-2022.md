Another great month for reading. So far this year, I've read 35 books, and I have so many on my TBR, it's sometimes hard to decide what to read next.

This month I did a Q&A about book blogging for my friends at Colchester WriteNight and was surprised by how long the discussion went on for - I never realised I had so much to say about it, or that other people would find it so interesting!

## Looking ahead...

Lots to look forward to, as always. How could I not jump straight on the blog tour for the new Joanna Cannon book, <cite>A Tidy Ending</cite>? <cite>The Carnival of Ash</cite>, by Tom Beckerlegge is another blog tour book that looks and sounds absolutely stunning.

I'm continuing my <cite>Six Stories</cite> readthrough with book five, <cite>Deity</cite> and finally delving into Vanda Symon's back catalogue having enjoyed <cite>Faceless</cite> last month, and [<cite>Bound</cite>](/blog-tour-bound/) \<mumbles>over a year ago\</mumbles>.
