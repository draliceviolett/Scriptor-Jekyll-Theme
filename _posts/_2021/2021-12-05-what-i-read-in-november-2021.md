After several months of reading fewer and fewer books, this month I read ten, which is more like me. All hail a successful pharmaceutical intervention after a year of less successful ones... let's hope it lasts.

27 November was the launch of the [Colchester WriteNight Anthology](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Colchester-WriteNight-Short-Prose-Collection-ebook/dp/B09KZR3QRZ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=colchester+writenight&qid=1638747383&sr=8-1)! If you're looking for Christmas present inspiration, it's a cracking collection of short stories by fab writers as well as myself. And now I can say I'm a published author.

And now, on with the round-up...

Getting back on my reading game in November has got me fired up for reading all sorts in December. A new Robert Bryndza book is always a treat, so I'm looking forward to <cite>Darkness Falls</cite> arriving on my Kindle. I'm also excited to continue my journey into Paul Cleave's backlist with <cite>The Cleaner</cite>.

Syd Moore is a great writer and all-round good egg, and of course <cite>The Twelve Even Stranger Days of Christmas</cite> is very appropriate reading this month anyway! <cite>Big Girl Small Town</cite> by Michelle Gallen is my [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) pick for December, interpreting the theme of 'a big book'.

I've been a fan of Andrew McMahon's music for more than half my life, which is kind of a scary thought, so I'm interested to learn more about his life and songs in <cite>Three Pianos</cite>.
