On the two-year anniversary of my book blog, I present to you my December 2020 round-up. As in November, I read 15 books - I was expecting it to be more, as I got two weeks off for Christmas, but I ended up filling the extra time with lots of TV and films instead!

Looking forward to the blog tour wagon rolling again in January, particularly as I've bagged a spot on the tour for the wonderful Laura Purcell's new novel, <cite>The Shape of Darkness</cite>! As a big fan of Stuart Macbride, Jonathan Coe, and Kate Rhodes, I'm also excited to read their latest offerings.

I really enjoyed Joe Moran's <cite>Shrinking Violets</cite> a few years ago, and <cite>If You Should Fail</cite> looks to be a comforting read for these difficult times.
