> "<cite>The C Word</cite> is a collection of short stories collated during the COVID-19 pandemic to raise money for NHS Together Charities. A plethora of wonderful stories created by a wide variety of writers, each with their own unique style. Some you will know already and some we’ve yet to introduce you to. However, we’re sure you’ll want to hear from each &amp; every one of them again as we leave 2020 behind us.

<cite>The C Word</cite> is a collection of 26 short stories published by SpellBound Books to raise money for NHS Together Charities. While there's an over-arching crime/supernatural theme, the stories differ in length, style and genre. As with all good short stories, for a few pages you're transported to a different world and get to know all sorts of characters, good, bad and ugly, very quickly!

While the title refers to COVID-19 and lockdown, only a few of the stories refer to them, and some more directly than others. That's a good thing, as it gives the collection a lot of variety - I'm not sure how much there would be if everyone had the brief to set their stories in lockdown, and it broadens the appeal of the book to readers who prefer escapism. There really is something for everyone here.

All of the stories have merit, but my personal favourites were the deliciously creepy 'Be Careful What You Wish For' by Linda Innes and 'Curse of Cassia' by Vanessa Morgan, the heartwarmingly supernatural 'The Haunted Trolley' by Nick Jackson and 'Zoom' by Elly Griffiths, and the brilliantly twisty 'Strength' by Andy Hill and 'Mrs Miller's Muffins' by Nic Parker. These and other outstanding stories from the anthology will stick with me for a while.

<cite>The C Word</cite> is a wonderfully eclectic collection of short stories, published for a good cause.
