December again, is it? Soon be time to stuff as much reading into the holiday period as I can, and pick out my top reads of the year.

But first: it's [Emotional Madness](https://www.colchesterartscentre.com/events/performance/emotional-madness-with-maryann-mates-4/) tonight, and I'm the 20-minute headliner! I'm reading out a speculative fiction/non-fiction mash-up that I'm quite pleased with. Hopefully the audience will like it, too.

## Looking ahead...

I'm on top of all my blog tour posts for the remainder of the year, so other than a handful of books that authors and publishers have directly asked me to review, this month I'm not planning what I read so much as seeing where the mood takes me.

While I'll aim to get to some books (and zines!) I've had on my TBR pile for a while, I think we all know by now that it won't actually get any smaller!
