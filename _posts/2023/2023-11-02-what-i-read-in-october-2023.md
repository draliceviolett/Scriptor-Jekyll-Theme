October was a busy month (in a good way!). As well as reading 15 books, I saw six Colchester Fringe shows and started work on my headline story for [Emotional Madness in December](https://www.colchesterartscentre.com/events/performance/emotional-madness-with-maryann-mates-4/). Plan for November is to finish it and start practising!

![Looking Within, Darkness Beckons, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, Sea of Tranquility, Private Inquiries](/images/october-2023-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>Looking Within: understanding ourselves through human imaging</cite>, by Cullen Ruff - 4*

[<cite>Darkness Beckons, edited by Mark Morris</cite>](/blog-tour-darkness-beckons/) - 4.5*

<cite>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</cite>, by Shirley Jackson - 4*

<cite>Sea of Tranquility</cite>, by Emily St. John Mandel - amazing, devoured it in one sitting. 5*

[<cite>Private Inquiries: The Secret History of Female Sleuths</cite>, by Caitlin Davies](/blog-tour-private-inquiries/) - 4*

![Stigma, The Rental Heart, The Hollow Sea, Black Rabbit Hall, Bloodchild](/images/october-2023-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>The Hollow Sea</cite>, by Annie Kirby - 4.5*

<cite>Black Rabbit Hall</cite>, by Eve Chase - 3.5*

<cite>Bloodchild and other stories</cite>, by Octavia E. Butler - my first Octavia Butler book and OMG, I'm in love. 5* 

![Sexed Up, His Favourite Graves, Kindred, All About Love, Upstairs at the Beresford](/images/october-2023-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>Sexed Up: How society sexualizes us, and how we can fight back</cite>, by Julia Serano - 4*

<cite>Kindred</cite>, by Octavia Butler - 4.5*

<cite>All About Love</cite>, by bell hooks - all the evergreen gems are already quoted all over the internet. Disappointingly, the rest of the book is outdated, preachy, and dull :( - 2*

## Looking ahead...

![Behold the Void, Frankissstein, Crow Face, Doll Face, Wild Seed, Yule Island](/images/october-2023-collage-4.jpg)

As ever, lots to look forward to. Having loved <cite>Bloodchild and other stories</cite> and <cite>Kindred</cite> last month, I'm looking forward to diving into Octavia E. Butler's Patternist series with <cite>Wild Seed</cite>.

Carly Holmes' contribution to [<cite>Darkness Beckons</cite>](/blog-tour-darkness-beckons/) was delightfully unsettling, so I'm excited to read her new novel, <cite>Crow Face, Doll Face</cite> for the blog tour this month.

Similarly, I've read Philip Fracassi's short fiction in a few places and think it's about time I read a whole book of his &ndash; namely, his <cite>Behold the Void</cite> collection.

<cite>Yule Island</cite>, by Johana Gustawsson, is another blog tour read I'm particularly looking forward to, having enjoyed [<cite>The Bleeding</cite>](/blog-tour-the-bleeding/) so much last year.

I'm also determined to read <cite>Frankissstein</cite>, by Jeanette Winterson, a) because it's been on my TBR pile for an embarrassingly long time, and b) because I've got my eye on a couple of other books by her, but feel like I should really read the one I have before I get them!
