**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

> 'The female private detective has been a staple of popular culture for over 
150 years, from Victorian lady sleuths to ‘busy-body spinsters’ and gun-toting modern PIs.

> 'But what about the real-life women behind these fictional tales – what crimes did they solve, and where are their stories?

> 'In <cite>Private Inquiries</cite>, Caitlin Davies traces the history of the UK’s female investigators, uncovering the truth about their lives and careers from the 1850s to the present day.

> 'Caitlin also follows in the footsteps of her subjects, undertaking a professional qualification to become a Private Investigator, and meeting modern PIs to disentangle fact from fiction.

> 'Female investigators are on the rise in the UK – and despite the industry’s sleazy reputation, nearly a third of new trainees are women. After a century of undercover work, it’s time to reveal the secrets of their trailblazing forebears.
