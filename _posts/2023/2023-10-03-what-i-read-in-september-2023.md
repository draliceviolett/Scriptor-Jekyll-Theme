In September, I read a reasonable 12 books... and definitely bought more than 12 books across physical (there may have been a London bookshop crawl...) and digital formats.

There are just so many things I want to read, and I never have the time and energy to get through as much as I'd like to!

Writing-wise, I didn't put too much pressure on myself &ndash; writing is my hobby, so I want it to be fun! I started a script collaboration with one of my Emotional Madness comrades, and I'm curious to see how it pans out.

I did a writing challenge that gave me ten days to write a story with a word limit of 3,000; I didn't feel especially inspired by the prompt, but I managed to submit a complete story of just under 1,500 words, which is better than nothing.

<cite>The Last House on Needless Street</cite>, by Catriona Ward - for the first two-thirds, you don't really know what's going on, then it hits you and you're like WOAH. 4.5*

<cite>Watching Neighbours Twice a Day: How '90s TV (Almost) Prepared Me for Life</cite>, by Josh Widdicombe - much needed light relief after my previous read! 4*

<cite>Breakable Things</cite>, by Cassandra Khaw - some of the stories I really liked, others went over my head. 3.5*

<cite>The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels</cite>, by Janice Hallett - missing the quaint/cosy vibes and tricksy clues of her previous books, but still very good. 4.5*

Having enjoyed previous anthologies in the series (including last year's [<cite>Close to Midnight</cite>](/blog-close-to-midnight/)), I'm excited to read <cite>Darkness Beckons</cite>, edited by Mark Morris, for the blog tour. I've already read the first story, by Nina Allan, and I'm very impressed so far!

I picked up *a lot* of Shirley Jackson, as well as <cite>The Rental Heart</cite>, by Kirsty Logan, and <cite>All About Love: New Visions</cite>, by bell hooks, on my travels last month, so I plan to get stuck in to those, too.
