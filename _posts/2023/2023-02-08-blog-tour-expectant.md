In <cite>Expectant</cite>, by Vanda Symon, Dunedin is shaken when a heavily pregnant young mother Aleisha Newman is found dead in an alleyway, her unborn child brutally taken from her.

Even though Detective Sam Shephard is approaching her due date herself, she's determined to take an active role in the investigation.

In doing so, she attracts the attention of a desperate killer, whose plight gets her - and the reader - thinking about the roles played by circumstances and intention when it comes to delivering justice.

As you'd guess from the description, <cite>Expectant</cite> doesn't pull any punches when it comes to engaging with one of the most horrific crimes imaginable.

The descriptions of what's been done to Aleisha are necessarily explicit and unflinching, and the reactions of the police and public are highly realistic.

Yet, despite the heavy material, I zoomed through <cite>Expectant</cite> due to the smooth writing style and continual developments, red herrings, and twists.

As with <cite>Overkill</cite> and [<cite>Bound</cite>](/blog-tour-bound/) (and presumably <cite>The Ringmaster</cite> and <cite>Containment</cite>, which I still have to look forward to!), Sam's character makes what could be quite a grim book a really enjoyable read.

Sam hasn't let pregnancy slow her down: she's still regularly falling afoul of her superiors by overstepping the boundaries of her role and running her mouth.

Along with her sense of humour (including some truly groan-worthy puns), I love Sam's enthusiasm for food, and her relationships: the one with her mum is hilarious; the one with her partner Paul is adorable; and the one with her best friend and former housemate Maggie is possibly one of my favourite female friendships in fiction.

<cite>Expectant</cite> is hard-hitting and fast-paced, with brilliant glimmers of light.
