In <cite>Dear Reader</cite>, Cathy Rentzenbrink takes us through her life in books, discussing the stories that got her through school, college and university, the tragic loss of her brother and post-university directionlessness, working in bookshops, for a literacy programme and as a writer, and family life. Along the way, she recommends her favourite books on a number of themes.

Of course, as a prolific reader myself (though on nowhere near the same level as Rentzenbrink), I was always going to enjoy this book. It was a massive thrill to read so many things that made me think 'yes!'. To name just three such things: her reliance on books to provide an escape in hard times; her suggestion that enjoying the Famous Five is an indication you're going to love crime fiction later on; and her conviction that the best memoirs don't just recount a life, but consider the nature of memory, truth and narrative.

I also agreed wholeheartedly that the sole purpose of adult literacy shouldn't be so you can fill in forms and get a job, but so you can derive enjoyment from reading books and maybe even write your own story.

At the same time, <cite>Dear Reader</cite> reminded me that no two bookworms have read all the same books, or experienced the books they have in common in the same way. So while I was excited to share Rentzenbrink's opinions on the wonderful <cite>What Was Lost</cite> by Catherine O'Flynn, as well as Elizabeth Jane Howard's Cazalet Chronicles and Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole diaries, I hadn't read a large chunk of the books she discussed or recommended (but will definitely be adding quite a few of them to my TBR!). By the same token, while she loved A. S. Byatt's <cite>Possession</cite> and Hanya Yanagihara's <cite>A Little Life</cite>, I couldn't get into the former and found the latter relentlessly depressing - the poor main character suffered one cruel misfortune after another.

I also enjoyed reading the author's recollections of working in bookshops. As with Shaun Bythell's <cite>Diary of a Bookseller</cite> and [<cite>Confessions of a Bookseller</cite>](/confessions-of-a-bookseller-by-shaun-bythell/), I found her experiences really interesting and funny/bemusing - but, having done my time in retail, I would never want that job myself! Rentzenbrink was suited to this work by her talkative nature - by contrast, I'm very socially awkward and find it much easier to express what I want to say about books online.

I loved watching Rentzenbrink progress from bookseller to manager to Quick Reads showrunner to writer, a journey she didn't start until she was 27. It's so nice to see someone become who they were always meant to be, and - proving everything she says about books bringing comfort and validation - it was life-affirming to read about someone else who didn't find their niche until their late 20s!

<cite>Dear Reader</cite> made my heart sing with recognition and inspiration. It got me thinking about what titles I'd mention if I wrote a book in the same vein. I imagine I'd talk about constantly rereading Louise Rennison's Georgia Nicolson series as a teenager (another influence on your reading experiences is your age - this set of books is very special to many of us who were teens in the early 2000s!). I'd discuss how I discovered post-colonial literature (such as Andrea Levy's <cite>Small Island</cite> and Zadie Smith's <cite>White Teeth</cite>) thanks to an A Level module, and only really reading fiction during the holidays as an undergraduate (notably Vikram Seth's <cite>A Suitable Boy</cite> trilogy during my breaks at Sainsbury's).

I'd go on to discuss getting back into reading during my post-university existential crisis, the many authors I discovered working in a charity shop and for a library service (too many to mention here, but this includes a lot of the crime authors whose books I pre-order as soon as they become available). I could mention the history books (Leonore Davidoff's <cite>Thicker Than Water</cite>, Simon Szreter & Kate Fisher's <cite>Sex Before the Sexual Revolution</cite>) and autobiographies (Antonia White, Elizabeth Goudge) I read for my PhD that left a lasting impression.

Unlike Rentzenbrink, I'm not much of a re-reader these days - not because I don't want to, but because I'm too susceptible to the lure of exciting-looking books I haven't read yet - but I would write about 2017, when I stuck to a New Year's resolution to reread one book for every two new ones. I'd then bring things bang up to date with the five-star books I might not have read had I not decided to ease my lockdown boredom by taking part in more blog tours (Simon Edge's [<cite>Anyone for Edmund?</cite>](/blog-tour-anyone-for-edmund) and Celia Rees' [<cite>Miss Graham's Cold War Cookbook</cite>](/blog-tour-miss-grahams-cold-war-cookbook/) to name just a couple!).
