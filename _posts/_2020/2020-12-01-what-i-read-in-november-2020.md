Another 15 books read. I don't know if I'm getting more critical in my old age, but I gave up on two books this month (not included in this list). Maybe if I'd read them at a different time, I'd have been more forgiving/been in the mood for that kind of book and stuck with them. Ho hum.

I don't have many tours/Netgalley reviews planned for this month because nothing really comes out in December. I also have two weeks of dead time to fill over Christmas, and I've found that blogging really helps me feel like I've achieved something on empty days. So I guess I'll be reviewing books I happened to be reading anyway, or producing a few end-of-year lists to keep myself sane.

<cite>Good Girl</cite>, by the ever-reliable Mel Sherratt, is the only December release I have on pre-order (other than a Netgalley download that could go either way). In December, I'm mainly going to be digging further into the back catalogues of authors I'm coming to love (hence the other four choices!) and working my way through my physical and digital library piles before they expire.
