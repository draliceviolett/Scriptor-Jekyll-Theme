I read another 17 books in August, and published nine reviews, seven of which were blog tour stops. Good thing I had lots of days off as I needed to use up my annual leave - it's weird taking holiday when there's not really anywhere to go...

## Looking ahead...

![Written in Bone, The Darkest Evening, In Black and White, Burnt Island, The Philosopher Queens](/images/august-2020-collage-5.jpg)

Lots of non-fiction coming up this month! I loved Sue Black's <cite>All That Remains</cite>, so I'm really excited to learn more about her work in <cite>Written in Bone</cite>. I'm on the blog tours for <cite>In Black and White</cite> and <cite>The Philosopher Queens</cite> (and got physical copies for review - squee!) and they both look so interesting!

Vera Stanhope is one of my favourite characters, let alone fictional detectives of all time, so naturally I've had Ann Cleeves' <cite>The Darkest Evening</cite> on pre-order since it was announced. And to my shame, I only read Kate Rhodes' brilliant <cite>Ruin Beach</cite> last month after having it on my TBR for over a year, and I definitely won't be leaving <cite>Burnt Island</cite> that long!
