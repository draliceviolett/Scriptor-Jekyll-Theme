I really enjoyed Hannah Rothschild's first novel, <cite>The Improbability of Love</cite>, a few years back, so I was excited when I joined Netgalley and saw I could read her new one, <cite>House of Trelawney</cite>, ahead of its official release. I wasn't disappointed: it was a lot of fun to read, and I loved watching the characters develop over the course of the story.

<cite>House of Trelawney</cite> follows the (mis)fortunes of various characters from the Trelawney family, members of the aristocracy who have lived on the same spot since the middle ages and are only just managing to hang on to their huge, crumbling ancestral home. We spend the most time with childhood friends Jane, who has married into the family and been burdened with the Sisyphean task of keeping the house as intact as she can with the family's dwindling finances and Blaze, the 'spare' daughter who lives a spartan life as a City trader.

As in <cite>The Improbability of Love</cite>, Rothschild isn't afraid to put her characters through the mill, and it's a credit to her writing that they're so likeable that you feel sorry for them and are cheering them on.

One quibble I did have, though, was that the characters kept referring to Apple as a 'new company' it would be wise to invest in. As Apple had been around for more than 30 years at that point, had been a mainstay in the PC market for quite some time, the iPod was well-established, and the iPhone had already been out for a year in 2008, I'm pretty sure everyone would have heard of them. I'd have also liked to have seen more of Aunt Tuffy as she was such an interesting character.

I would recommend <cite>House of Trelawney</cite> to fans of Jonathan Coe, as well as anyone who enjoyed <cite>One Week</cite>, by Sebastian Faulks, and <cite>Capital</cite>, by John Lanchester.
