## The book

> 'The 30th century is a technological paradise. Androids have built a utopian future of advanced robotics, augmented reality, and simulated worlds. Humanity thrives across the Thirteen Suns.

> 'Why not spread some chaos, shake things up a bit?

> 'Aster Vale leads a secret life as the Wildflower, a competitive street artist with dreams of infamy. When her father joins a mysterious research project in the Vega System, Aster sees their luxury starcruiser as just another canvas to explore. How else is she supposed to channel all this teenage rebellion?

> 'But not everyone prospers in this world of synthetic gods. Rel Akepri is a young soldier from a broken planet, genetically engineered for war. The research project in the Vega System now threatens the fate of his people, and he must embark upon a deadly mission to stop it.

> 'Rel's orders: intercept the starcruiser on its voyage to Vega, or face extinction.

> 'Perhaps Aster might find something new to fight for.'

I read a 10,000-word extract of <cite>A Star Named Vega</cite> for the second round of the competition and I would have loved to have seen it get through to the final round (and read the whole thing - another one for the ever-growing TBR list!).

My impression is that it was really imaginative and well-written, and I was mesmerised by Aster's world. Also, how stunning is that cover?
