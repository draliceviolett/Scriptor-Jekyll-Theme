I read 13 books in August, which is the most I've read in one month for a while, but lots of them were short story collections, which tend to have fewer pages.

I went short story mad because I needed to write one myself for my performance at [Emotional Madness with Mary-Ann and Mates at Colchester Arts Centre on Monday 12 September](https://www.colchesterartscentre.com/events/performance/emotional-madness-with-maryann-mates/). If you're local, I'd love you to come along - I'm really proud of what I've come up with.

Plus, I only seem able to complete writing projects when I've been specifically invited to come up with something, so if the night is a success, chances are I'll get asked to do it again, increasing my output. Otherwise, I mostly default to reading in my spare time, so without further ado...

<cite>The Haunting of Lás Lagrimas</cite>, by W. M. Cleese - 4.5*

[<cite>Muzungu</cite>, by Rod Madocks](/blog-tour-muzungu/) - 4*, purely because it gave me SO MANY THOUGHTS.

[<cite>Cold Fish Soup</cite>, by Adam Farrer](/blog-tour-cold-fish-soup/) - 5*

<cite>Supporting Cast</cite>, by Kit de Waal - 4*

![Ways of Living, Hotel Obscure, The Lament of the Silver Badger, The Lottery and other stories](/images/august-2022-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>Ways of Living</cite>, by Gemma Seltzer - that feeling when you read an author's work and wish you could write like them. 5*

<cite>Hotel Obscure</cite>, by Lisette Brodey - 4.5*

<cite>The Lament of the Silver Badger</cite>, by Oli Jacobs - 4*

<cite>The Lottery and other stories</cite>, by Shirley Jackson - loved loved LOVED this. I was underwhelmed when I read <cite>The Haunting of Hill House</cite> a few years back, and I'm so glad I gave Shirley Jackson another chance.

![A Narrow Door, The Last to Disappear, The Rising Tide, My Name is Leon, The Bleeding](/images/august-2022-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>A Narrow Door</cite>, by Joanne Harris - 4.5*

<cite>The Last to Disappear</cite>, by Jo Spain - my pick for August's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/), though I couldn't make it to the Zoom in the end. 4*

[<cite>The Rising Tide</cite>, by Ann Cleeves](/blog-tour-the-rising-tide) - 5*

<cite>My Name is Leon</cite>, by Kit de Waal - 4.5*

[<cite>The Bleeding</cite>, by Johana Gustawsson, translated by David Warriner](/blog-tour-the-bleeding/) - 4.5*

## Looking ahead...

![Shrines of Gaiety, Thirteen, Without Warning & Only Sometimes, Black Hearts, The Moose Paradox](/images/august-2022-collage-4.jpg)

I get ridiculously excited whenever Kate Atkinson has a new book out, so of course I'll be pre-ordering <cite>Shrines of Gaiety</cite>. Kind of gutted to have missed the blog tour invite for it, but it's a good excuse to buy a fancy edition of it.

Two blog tours I do have coming up are <cite>Black Hearts</cite>, by Doug Johnstone, and <cite>The Moose Paradox</cite>, by Antti Tuomainen, having enjoyed other books by them. I also plan to continue my newfound Kit de Waal obsession with her recently-published memoir, <cite>Without Warning & Only Sometimes</cite>.

This month's Book Shelf Raiders theme is "a book back in time", which I'm interpreting as "a book I've had in my pile for a shamefully long time". I picked up <cite>Thirteen</cite>, by Steve Cavanagh, at an author event in 2018 and even though I keep hearing about how great it is (especially at the BSR meetings!), I just haven't got to it. I can just tell I'm going to be kicking myself for not making time for it earlier.
