If May was a ridiculous month for reading and writing, June was a bit quieter. I went on a bit of a historical novel (and novel where characters make small things) kick, and those do tend to be a bit chunky!

Writing-wise, I did a 1,000-word horror story for a 48-hour challenge that I don't think was my finest work.

I also wrote a piece about [writing the self safely with micro creative nonfiction](https://sarah-i-jackson.ghost.io/writing-the-self-safely-with-micro-creative-non-fiction/) for Sarah I Jackson's Words and inner worlds blog, and I'm super-pleased with how it turned out. Please do give it a read :)

[<cite>The Fascination</cite>, by Essie Fox](/blog-tour-the-fascination/) - 4.5*

<cite>The Trick to Time</cite>, by Kit de Waal - 5*

<cite>The Clockwork Girl</cite>, by Anna Mazzola - 4.5*

<cite>The Miniaturist</cite>, by Jessie Burton - re-read, as I bought <cite>The House of Fortune</cite> and realised I couldn't remember very much at all about its predecessor. I actually liked it better this time around! 5*

![Voices of the Dead, Migraine, You Can't See Me, Danged Black Thing](/images/june-2023-collage-2.jpg)

[<cite>Voices of the Dead</cite>, by Ambrose Parry](/blog-tour-voices-of-the-dead/) - 5*

<cite>Migraine</cite>, by Oliver Sacks - on the one hand, I learned I've been having migraines for at least 28 years (always thought they were 'just headaches' because I don't get visual disturbances), and I seem to be dealing with them better after reading this. On the other hand, it's a bit boring and repetitive, and I prefer his books that go all-in on the case studies. 3.5*

[<cite>You Can't See Me</cite>, by Eva Björg Ægisdóttir, translated by Victoria Cribb](/blog-tour-you-cant-see-me/) - 4.5*

[<cite>Danged Black Thing</cite>, by Eugen Bacon](/danged-black-thing-by-eugen-bacon/) - 4*

![The Ghost Theatre, The Three of Us, Lessons in Chemistry](/images/june-2023-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>The Ghost Theatre</cite>, by Mat Osman - 4*

[<cite>The Three of Us</cite>, by Ore Agbaje-Williams](/blog-tour-the-three-of-us/) - 4*

<cite>Lessons in Chemistry</cite>, by Bonnie Garner - it could never possibly live up to the hype, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. 4*

## Looking ahead...

![Water Child, The House of Fortune, 13 Doors, Life Among the Savages, Salt & Skin](/images/june-2023-collage-4.jpg)

I've already started <cite>The House of Fortune</cite>, by Jessie Burton, having re-read <cite>The Miniaturist</cite> in preparation, as mentioned above.

If June was the month of historical/craft fiction, July looks to have a bit of a sea theme, as I'm on the blog tours for <cite>Water Child</cite>, by Mathew West, and <cite>Salt & Skin</cite>, by Eliza Henry-Jones. I've also got <cite>13 Doors</cite>, by Gary Phelps, representing horror.

It's Primadonna Festival again this month, and I can't wait! I'm planning to take Shirley Jackson's <cite>Life Among the Savages</cite> along with me, as I don't really want to take my Kindle, and short stories are easier to read in snatches of time than novels.

If last year is anything to go by, I'll come back from the festival with a few new books, so I'd better read some of the titles on the teetering TBR next to my bed to make some space!
