In July, I read 20 books. I don't know how this happened, I certainly wasn't trying to read that many! And I didn't actually read all the ones I said I would in last month's round-up...

When I wasn't reading more books than I realised, I watched <cite>Little Fires Everywhere</cite> on Amazon Prime, and <cite>The Baby-sitters Club</cite> on Netflix. Both are close enough to the books to satisfy me, yet I didn't feel like I was going over old ground, especially with the latter, where they've diversified the cast and added present-day issues. The <cite>BSC</cite> gave me massive warm and fuzzies and I can't wait for more!

Putting <cite>The Narrow Land</cite> and <cite>Blood & Sugar</cite> on the list again because I really do want to read them and mean to do so this month!

New books from Mark Billingham, Val McDermid and Lissa Evans are always a must-read-ASAP treat, and I'm excited to be on the <cite>V for Victory</cite> blog tour!
