I read another 11 books in April - 11 or 12 books a month seems to be the standard for me in 2022, which is nothing to complain about.

This month I booked tickets for a few [Essex Book Festival](https://essexbookfestival.org.uk/) events in June, and time off in July for [Primadonna Festival](https://primadonnafestival.com/), which I'll buy my ticket for next week. A multi-day festival of books that's close enough for me to travel to and from each day (I'm just really passionate about sleeping indoors, in a proper bed)? Yes!

So I'm very excited for the next few months. It's such a turnaround from this time last year, when I felt like there was nothing left for me and I couldn't imagine feeling OK, let alone good, ever again.

## Looking ahead...

![No Less the Devil, The Ruin of all Witches, The Man Who Died, Demon](/images/april-2022-collage-4.jpg)

Stuart MacBride books are an auto-buy for me whenever there's a new one, so I'm looking forward to reading <cite>No Less the Devil</cite>. I'll also be finishing Matt Wesolowski's Six Stories series this month, with <cite>Demon</cite>.

I'm halfway through a fortnight where I don't need to read anything for a blog tour, and I've been using the time to tackle my physical TBR pile. I bought my erstwhile academic advisor Malcolm Gaskill's <cite>The Ruin of All Witches</cite> in the post-Christmas sales, so it's about time I got to it.

I might actually make it to [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) in May. This month's theme is 'author/title that starts with the same letter as your name'. Having absoutely loved <cite>The Rabbit Factor</cite>, I'm really keen to read more Antti Tuomainen, so <cite>The Man Who Died</cite> seems like an obvious choice!
