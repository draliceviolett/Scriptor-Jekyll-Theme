In <cite>The Polite Act of Drowning</cite>, by Charleen Hurtubise, we follow teenager Joanne Kennedy over the course of one formative summer in Kettle Lake, Michigan, where she lives with her parents, older sister Hare, and younger brother Sammy, with other relatives close by.

The summer begins with a teenage girl from another town drowning in the nearby Great Lake, which seems to kick-start a number of rites of passage for Joanne: making a new friend who threatens to lead her astray; exploring her sexuality; discovering family secrets and that her parents are complicated humans with emotional lives of their own; and finding alternative adults who can guide her.

Gawky, under-confident, and accustomed to being in the shadow of her popular and conventionally pretty older sister, will Joanne sink amidst all these churning currents, or emerge with a stronger sense of who she is and what makes her unique?

I found <cite>The Polite Act of Drowning</cite> absorbing and intoxicating, reading it all in about 24 hours as I dived back into it whenever I got the chance.

Hurtubise's descriptions of the wetlands of Michigan are so detailed and beautiful, it really was like being transported there. The progressive revelation of the tragic past of Joanne's mum, and the build-up to a comparable event at the climax of the story, also kept me intrigued and turning the pages.

The author faithfully captures what it's like to be an ugly ducking of a teenager, surrounded by swans who look upon you with disdain. I could totally empathise with Joanne's solitary summer existence, as well as the hopes raised in her by the possibility of friendship with Lucinda, a troubled girl fostered by a family friend.

Lucinda is also realistically drawn as a young woman who's been through some things and learned to present herself as battle-hardened, indifferent, and older than she really is, yet is highly damaged, as well as vulnerable, due to her tender age and the lack of love in her life to date.

It was gratifying to watch Joanne find ways to deal with what was going on around her, and even bloom. Like Min in [<cite>Salt & Skin</cite>, by Eliza Henry-Jones](/blog-tour-salt-and-skin/), swimming helps her cope with her problems, and she's hella good at it. Both books have made me wish I was less hopeless at swimming myself!

I additionally felt moved by Joanne's interactions with sympathetic adults, particularly Marylou &ndash; a particularly warm-hearted character I couldn't get enough of &ndash; and, later on, Aunt Rita.

<cite>The Polite Act of Drowning</cite> is an immersive, heady, and satisfying coming-of-age novel.
