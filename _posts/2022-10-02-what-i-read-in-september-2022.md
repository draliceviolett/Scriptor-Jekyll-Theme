I haven't just been reading silently this past month - I also performed a short story, "Transformation", at Emotional Madness with Mary-Ann and Mates at Colchester Arts Centre, which went down well enough for me to be invited to submit a piece for the podcast of one of my fellow performers! So I ended up writing and recording a little something extra, which should be online for all to hear in the not-too-far future.

Here's what I read in my head in September...

<cite>Dark Tales</cite>, by Shirley Jackson - very good, but <cite>The Lottery and other stories</cite> has the edge because it's better-curated. 4*

[<cite>The Witches of Moonshyne Manor</cite>, by Bianca Marais](/blog-tour-the-witches-of-moonshyne-manor/) - 4*

## Looking ahead...

I didn't get to read Kate Atkinson's new novel, <cite>Shrines of Gaiety</cite>, last month as it was dispatched late due to the Waterstone's SNAFU (although I might not have had time due to tour commitments), but as it's now on its way, I'm hopeful of reading it in October.

Other books I'm particularly keen to read this month are Paul Cleave's <cite>The Pain Tourist</cite> (having enjoyed his other books) and Paul O'Neill's <cite>With Dust Shall Cover</cite> (what with being on a short story kick), both for blog tours.

I'm planning to read <cite>The Tyranny of Lost Things</cite>, by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett for this month's Book Shelf Raiders (theme: a debut book). Maybe I'll actually make it to the Zoom this time!
