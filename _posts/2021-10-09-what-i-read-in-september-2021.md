Uncharacteristically late with my September round-up. Blame my broken brain! At least they were all good, though.

![The Heron's Cry, The Seven Ages of Death, How to be Broken, The Devil You Know](/images/september-2021-collage-1.jpg)

[<cite>The Heron's Cry</cite>, by Ann Cleeves](/blog-tour-the-herons-cry/) - 4.5*

<cite>The Seven Ages of Death: A Forensic Pathologist's Journey Through Life</cite>, by Dr Richard Shepherd - fascinating, but sometimes the way he talks about people is a bit snobby. Why is it so surprising that someone who lives in poor quality housing is smart enough to conceal a murder? 4.5*

<cite>How to be Broken: The Advantages of Falling Apart</cite>, by Dr Emma Kavanagh - 4*

<cite>The Devil You Know: Stories of human cruelty and compassion</cite>, by Dr Gwen Adshead & Eileen Horne - 4.5*

![The Dark Side of the Mind, A Corruption of Blood, To All the Living, Three Women](/images/september-2021-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>The Dark Side of the Mind: True Stories from My Life as a Forensic Psychologist</cite>, by Kerry Daynes - the dark humour absolutely made this for me. 5*

<cite>A Corruption of Blood</cite>, by Ambrose Parry - 4.5*

[<cite>To All the Living</cite>, by Monica Felton](/blog-tour-to-all-the-living/) - 4*

<cite>Three Women</cite>, by Lisa Taddeo - my pick for September's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/). 4*

## Looking ahead...

Okay, so I've read two of these in the past nine days... I can already confirm that <cite>The Kingdoms</cite>, by Natasha Pulley, and <cite>The Lighthouse Witches</cite>, by C. J. Cooke are very good, and actually have some fundamental things in common, but it's hard to say what without spoilers! <cite>The Lighthouse Witches</cite> is for a blog tour, as is <cite>Dark Secrets</cite>, by Sally Rigby.

I really enjoyed reading a couple of Carol Shields books for previous blog tours, so when I realised two more books had come out with the new covers, I had to complete the set and will read at least one of them, <cite>Mary Swann</cite>, this month.
