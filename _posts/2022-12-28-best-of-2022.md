I know I might well fit another one or two reads into 2022, but I didn't want to wait any longer to do my round-up of the year. And I know 17 is a strange number, but I couldn't bear to drop any of the titles I'd chosen to make a nice round 16 or (god forbid) 15. My blog, my rules.

I went into 2022 cautiously optimistic - I had an absolute shocker mental health-wise in 2021, but right at the end I finally got the right medication and was embarking on the right therapy. And you know what? It's been alright, actually.

This year, I got promoted and made some bang-up webpages at work, went to Primadonna Festival (first time camping in my life - I'm not exactly a convert, but in this case it was worth it), read out a short story at Emotional Madness (there's [another show in January](https://www.colchesterartscentre.com/events/performance/emotional-madness-with-maryann-mates-1/)), and was on the [A Hug from the Moon podcast](https://anchor.fm/leon638/episodes/Ep-3--flash-bang-wallop-e1phu6a).

But I also underwent my first ever dental surgeries (a root canal, followed by an extraction because the tooth was too far gone), took my arm out of action for a few weeks by faceplanting while running for a bus, and this week, I finally got covid. I'm lucky - it's just been like a heavy cold in my case. Still, 1/10, would not recommend.

I've mostly been listening to Silversun Pickups, playing Wingspan, and streaming shows about characters much younger than myself (<cite>Derry Girls</cite>, <cite>We Are Lady Parts</cite>, <cite>Heartstopper</cite>, <cite>High School</cite>, <cite>Wednesday</cite>).

In 2023, I'm going to be more intentional with my writing. I also expect I'll continue to add more books to my TBR than I manage to complete.

## Short fiction

I went absolutely wild for short fiction this year, spanning the range from a tad quirky/unsettling to full-blown horror.

I read quite a few collections, but the work of Daisy Johnson (<cite>Fen</cite>), Shirley Jackson (<cite>The Lottery and other stories</cite>, Gemma Seltzer (<cite>Ways of Living</cite>), and C. J. Tudor (<cite>A Sliver of Darkness</cite>) particularly had me going 'yes, this is the writing I aspire to. I want to *be* this author'.

Meanwhile, [<cite>Close to Midnight</cite>](/blog-close-to-midnight/), edited by Mark Morris, is one of those rare beasts: an anthology with no duds. Though there are, of course, stories in it that especially stuck in my mind and made me think 'I want to write something like that'.

## Memoir

I love a well-written, good-quality memoir. Not only am I fascinated by other people's experiences but (nerd alert) I enjoy thinking about how the writer has approached and constructed it, what lenses they're viewing their past experiences through, and what wider messages they convey by telling their story.

[<cite>A Normal Family</cite>, by Chrysta Bilton](/blog-tour-a-normal-family/), [<cite>Cold Fish Soup</cite>, by Adam Farrer](/blog-tour-cold-fish-soup/), and <cite>Without Warning & Only Sometimes</cite>, by Kit de Waal stood out to me for being especially interesting, sophisticated, well-written, and entertaining.

## Books from new and new-to-me authors

You know when you're reading a book, and the whole time you're like 'wow, I love this, this is amazing and will definitely be on my best-of-the-year list'?

These are five of them, four by debut authors (<cite>The Seawomen</cite>, by Chloe Timms, [<cite>Peach Blossom Spring</cite>, by Melissa Fu](/blog-tour-peach-blossom-spring/), [<cite>The Flames</cite>, by Sophie Haydock](/blog-tour-the-flames), and <cite>The Porcelain Doll</cite>, by Kirsten Loesch) and one by an author whose other books I hadn't read ([<cite>Dashboard Elvis is Dead</cite>, by David F. Ross](/blog-tour-dashboard-elvis-is-dead/)).

## New and new-to-me books from favourite authors

More 'wow' books, this time from authors I was already familiar with. A new Kate Atkinson book is always a treat, and I found <cite>Shrines of Gaiety</cite> to be no exception.

I enjoyed [<cite>Villager</cite>, by Tom Cox](/blog-tour-villager/) so much that I read it twice in as many months so I could fully do it justice on the blog tour!

<cite>Good Omens</cite>, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman had been on my TBR since the TV series came out in 2019, and I was kicking myself for not getting around to it for so long.

<cite>The Book of Form & Emptiness</cite>, by Ruth Ozeki, was the first book I finished in 2022 and an honourable mention in [last year's list](/best-of-2021) as I started reading it a year ago today and knew I wouldn't finish it in 2021.

I feel like I should add here: a few of my favourite authors have brought out new books this year but I haven't got round to buying/reading them yet! So they may well be on my 2023 list.
