I seem to be reading one book less each month. At this rate, in April 2022 I'll be reading nothing! Can't have that happening.

<cite>The Kingdoms</cite>, by Natasha Pulley = 4*

## Looking ahead...

Once again, I've read two of these books (<cite>Psychopaths Anonymous</cite>, by Will Carver, and <cite>The Haunting Season</cite>) in the part of the month that has elapsed so far, and very good they were too! <cite>Psychopaths Anonymous</cite> was for a blog tour, as is Hazel Prior's <cite>Call of the Penguins</cite>, both tours I signed up to on the strength of the authors' previous novels.

This month's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) theme is 'judge a book by its cover', and I have quite a few books I've had so long that I've forgotten the blurbs but the covers look nice! I picked out a selection and asked what I should read on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/alicemcalicepants) and <cite>The Book Collector</cite> by Alice Thompson and <cite>Conjure Women</cite>, by Afia Atakora came out equally, so I'll read both and see which I have more to say about in the meeting.
