My mental health hasn't been great again this month, but I've been continuing to use books to keep myself entertained and help myself understand what's happening to me, as well as give myself things to look forward too.

## Looking ahead...

![Fragile, The Missing Sister, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, Ghosts](/images/may-2021-collage-4.jpg)

I've been waiting *ages* for <cite>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</cite>, by V. E. Schwab, and <cite>Ghosts</cite>, by Dolly Alderton, to come through from the library, so I'm excited they've finally turned up!

I'm a big fan of Sarah Hilary's books, so I'm looking forward to being on the blog tour for <cite>Fragile</cite>. And having devoured the whole of Lucinda Riley's Seven Sisters series so far, I can't wait to read <cite>The Missing Sister</cite>, though it's really long so I don't know if I'll finish it this month.
