Just like that, we're at the end of another year, and I'm writing my sixth annual reading round-up.

While 2024 isn't going to go down as a particularly memorable year for me (except in a 'well, at least the horrors of 2025 hadn't yet been unleashed' way), pulling together this collection reminded me that at least I read some stunning books.

According to Goodreads, I finished 152 books (though I might get another one or two in before the bongs). I've sorted my top 26 into categories, mainly for collage management &ndash; some of them fit under more than one heading, I know.

## Hot off the press

The best thing about doing blog tours is getting to read some fantastic books that might not have otherwise crossed my path, and right when they're just coming out, too. Here are four such books I couldn't recommend highly enough this year.

![In Memory of Us, Daughters of the Nile, True Love, This Motherless Land](/images/2024-hot-off-the-press.jpg)

[<cite>In Memory of Us</cite>, by Jacqueline Roy](/blog-tour-in-memory-of-us/)

[<cite>Daughters of the Nile</cite>, by Zahra Barri](/blog-tour-daughters-of-the-nile/)

[<cite>True Love</cite>, by Paddy Crewe](/blog-tour-true-love/)

[<cite>This Motherless Land</cite>, by Nikki May](/blog-tour-this-motherless-land/)

## New(ish) books from old favourites

Of course, this isn't the first year I've found a new favourite author to follow as a result of signing up for a blog tour (this is how I got into [Gabby Hutchinson Crouch in 2021](/blog-tour-wish-you-werent-here/) &ndash; her latest book, <cite>Cursed Under London</cite>, is on the TBR).

Blog tours are also a great way to get some of my existing favourite authors' new books a little early, for free (though I have also spent money on Doug Johnstone's books, mostly as gifts for other people!).

In other cases, I've bought myself new/recent books by authors I love, and found them on top form. 

![Past Lying, The Half Life of Valery K, Home Sweet Hell](/images/2024-old-favourites-1.jpg)

<cite>Past Lying</cite>, by Val McDermid

<cite>The Half Life of Valery K</cite>, by Natasha Pulley

<cite>Home Sweet Hell</cite>, by Gabby Hutchinson Crouch

![Hell Bent, Death at the Sign of the Rook, Living is a Problem](/images/2024-old-favourites-2.jpg)

<cite>Hell Bent</cite>, by Leigh Bardugo

<cite>Death at the Sign of the Rook</cite>, by Kate Atkinson

[<cite>Living is a Problem</cite>, by Doug Johnstone](/blog-tour-living-is-a-problem/)

## Sci-fi

This was the year I really started to appreciate what contemporary sci-fi and speculative fiction has to offer: awe-inspiring facts, wondrous environments and visions of the future, and diverse, relateable characters who cooperate with one another.

These titles particularly embodied these qualities for me this year &ndash; some author duplication with the previous and next categories here!

![The Infinite, The Collapsing Wave, The Mars House, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet](/images/2024-sci-fi.jpg)

<cite>The Infinite</cite>, by Ada Hoffmann

[<cite>The Collapsing Wave</cite>, by Doug Johnstone](/blog-tour-the-collapsing-wave/)

<cite>The Mars House</cite>, by Natasha Pulley

<cite>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</cite>, by Becky Chambers

## New favourite authors

You know that thing, when you discover/get into a new-to-you author who already has a few books out, so you suddenly have loads of reading to look forward to? Brilliant, isn't it? (This is equally applicable to music.)

![To Be Taught If Fortunate, And Her Smile Will Untether the Universe, Babel](/images/2024-new-favourites.jpg)

<cite>To Be Taught If Fortunate</cite>, by Becky Chambers

<cite>And Her Smile Will Untether the Universe</cite>, by Gwendolyn Kiste

<cite>Babel</cite>, by R. F. Kuang

## Short stories

While I may not have *written* many short stories (and certainly not any I polished off) this year, I still love reading them across genres, and regardless of age. Again, a little cross-category author duplication here.

![The Haunted Tea Set and other stories, The Art of Space Travel and other stories, Intervals of Darkness](/images/2024-short-stories-1.jpg)

[<cite>The Haunted Tea Set and other stories</cite>, by Sarah Jackson](/the-haunted-tea-set-by-sarah-jackson/)

<cite>The Art of Space Travel and other stories</cite>, by Nina Allan

<cite>Intervals of Darkness</cite>, by Ray Newman

![The Birds and other stories, The Hotel, Not the End of the World](/images/2024-short-stories-2.jpg)

<cite>The Birds and other stories</cite>, by Daphne du Maurier

<cite>The Hotel</cite>, by Daisy Johnson

<cite>Not the End of the World</cite>, by Kate Atkinson

## Non-fiction

I feel like I neglected non-fiction a bit this year. Even so, I came across some creative, enlightening, excellent examples of the genre.

![Girl Unmasked, In the Dream House, Ace](/images/2024-non-fiction.jpg)

[<cite>Girl Unmasked</cite>, by Emily Katy](/blog-tour-girl-unmasked/)

<cite>In the Dream House</cite>, by Carmen Maria Machado

<cite>Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex</cite>, by Angela Chen

**So there you have it &ndash; my top reads of 2024.** If nothing else, I have plenty more books to look forward to in 2025!
