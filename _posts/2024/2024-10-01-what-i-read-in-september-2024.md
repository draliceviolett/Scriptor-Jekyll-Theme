If August was the month of buying many games, September was the month of buying many books. Went to a couple of London bookshops with my friends and found a bunch of titles I'd had on my wishlist for a while. Had to be done.

I still don't feel like writing much fiction, but after a couple of weeks without any reviews in the diary, I'm feeling refreshed and pleased with the blog posts I've written for tomorrow and the day after.

![The Cloisters, Living is a Problem, The Rendezvous and other stories, The Once and Future Witches](/images/september-2024-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>The Cloisters</cite>, by Katy Hays - nice concept, dull execution, main character going to be very disappointed when she realises being an academic is actually just like any other job. 3*

[<cite>Living is a Problem</cite>, by Doug Johnstone](/blog-tour-living-is-a-problem/) - 5*

<cite>The Rendezvous and other stories</cite>, by Daphne Du Maurier - 4.5*

<cite>The Once and Future Witches</cite>, by Alix E. Harrow - 4.5*

![Intervals of Darkness, Daughters of Night, The Birds and other stories, Arden](/images/september-2024-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>Intervals of Darkness</cite>, by Ray Newman - 5*

<cite>Daughters of Night</cite>, by Laura Shepherd-Robinson - solid, but a bit of a slog. 3.5*

<cite>The Birds and other stories</cite>, by Daphne Du Maurier - 5*

[<cite>Arden</cite>, by GD Harper](/arden-by-gd-harper/) - 4*

![Not the End of the World, Ghost Story, To Be Taught, If Fortunate, Ace](/images/september-2024-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>Not the End of the World</cite>, by Kate Atkinson - 5*

[<cite>Ghost Story</cite>, by Elisa Lodato](/blog-tour-ghost-story/) - 4*

<cite>To Be Taught, If Fortunate</cite>, by Becky Chambers - my first Becky Chambers book, and I found it stunning. 5*

<cite>Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex</cite>, by Angela Chen - enlightening and extremely validating. 5*

## Looking ahead...

It's that time of the year again... I've just started <cite>Elemental Forces</cite>, the fifth of Mark Morris' annual anthologies of superlative new horror, which are always a treat.

As this and previous round-ups may have indicated, I'm having a Daphne Du Maurier phase &ndash; actually my second, as I read some of her novels in my lost two years between undergrad and postgrad, more than a decade ago. I filled my boots in Daunt Books, so I have no excuse not to keep going!

I've been meaning to read Julie Sondra Decker's <cite>The Invisible Orientation: An Introduction to Asexuality</cite> for some time, so I was more than happy to make it part of my Gay's The Word haul!
