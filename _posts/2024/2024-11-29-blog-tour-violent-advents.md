**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [ZooLoo's Book Tours](https://zooloosbookdiary.co.uk/zooloos-blog-tours). I received a free copy of the book in return for a spotlight post.**

> 'There is more to fear on a silent night than who is coming down the chimney. The
writers of this anthology present to you a feast of festive frights.

> 'Read them if you dare, and find out why you should never turn your back on the centerpiece of this joyous holiday... the Christmas tree.'

<cite>Violent Advents</cite> features 26 dark and gruesome stories on a Christmas theme, and all royalties will be donated to the British Heart Foundation and the American Heart Association!
