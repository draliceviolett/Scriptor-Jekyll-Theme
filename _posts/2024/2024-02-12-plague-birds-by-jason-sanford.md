**I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in return for an honest review.**

> 'Glowing red lines split their faces. Shock-red hair and clothes warn people to flee their approach. They are plague birds, the powerful merging of humans and artificial intelligences who serve as judges and executioners after the collapse of civilization.

> 'And the plague birdsâ€™ judgment is swift and deadly, as Crista discovered as a child when she watched one kill her mother.

> 'In a world of gene-modded humans constantly watched over by benevolent AIs, everyone hates and fears the plague birds. But to save her father and home village, Crista becomes the very creature she fears the most. And her first task as a plague bird is hunting down an ancient group of murderers wielding magic-like powers.

> 'As Crista and her AI symbiote travel farther from home than she ever imagined, they are plunged into a strange world where she judges wrongdoers, befriends other outcasts, and uncovers an extremely personal conspiracy that threatens the lives of millions.'

<cite>Plague Birds</cite>, by Jason Sanford, is set in a far, post-collapse future where humans look very different from today.

Not only do they sport animalistic features from ancestral genetic modification, but a select, marginalised few &ndash; the eponymous plague birds &ndash; share their bodies with powerful AIs whose role is to judge and execute wrongdoers.

When a plague bird, Derena, sustains life-threatening injuries in an attack near 18-year-old Crista's village, Crista reluctantly agrees to become the new host for Derena's wise-cracking AI symbiote, Red Day.

Together, Crista and Red Day embark on a hero's journey to a remote monastery, and then a legendary city, on the trail of Derena's killers, who turn out to be a threat to the world as Crista knows it, with a surprisingly long history.
