April was just another month. I didn't do any creative writing of value (my brain is a story idea desert so far this year), but I read more big books, genre books, and books I'd been meaning to get to for a while.

![Starling House, Being Act, Starstruck, Fall River](/images/april-2024-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>Starling House</cite>, by Alix E. Harrow - 4*

<cite>Being Ace - An Anthology of Queer, Trans, Femme, and Disabled Stories of Asexual Love and Connection</cite>, edited by Madeline Dyer - I don't know if it was because it was quite YA-oriented, but only a couple of stories really stood out to me. I *so* wanted to like this, but it was kinda "meh" for me. 3*

<cite>Starstruck</cite>, by S. E. Anderson - from the writer of my favourite story in the anthology above. 4*

[<cite>Fall River</cite>, by Meredith Miller](/blog-tour-fall-river/) - 4.5*

![Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal, Our Hideous Progeny, What We Did in the War, Yellowface](/images/april-2024-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal</cite>, by Jeanette Winterson - 4*

<cite>Our Hideous Progeny</cite>, by C. E. McGill - 4.5*

[<cite>What We Did in the War</cite>, by Jennie Walters](/blog-tour-what-we-did-in-the-war/) - 4*

<cite>Yellowface</cite>, by Rebecca F. Kuang - 4*

![The Other Tenant, Hell Bent, House of Kwa, Patternmaster](/images/april-2024-collage-3.jpg)

[<cite>The Other Tenant</cite>, by Lesley Kara](/blog-tour-the-other-tenant/) - 4.5*

<cite>Hell Bent</cite>, by Leigh Bardugo - brilliant, even if I did have to keep looking up characters and events because I read <cite>Ninth House</cite> in 2019! 5*

[<cite>House of Kwa</cite>, by Mimi Kwa](/blog-tour-house-of-kwa/) - 4.5*

<cite>Patternmaster</cite>, by Octavia Butler - 4*

## Looking ahead...

Apart from scheduled blog tours, I think May is going to be another month where I let my mood dictate what books I pick up from my TBR pile/wishlist. I have a couple of possible reads in mind, but I'm open to diversions. I may surprise myself!
