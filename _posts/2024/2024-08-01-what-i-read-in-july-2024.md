July was relatively light in terms of blog tours, so I had time to read a couple of rather long books that had been on my TBR pile for a while.

I continue to only write fiction when prompted to in my writing groups, and even then, I stay in my comfort zone, i.e. Carol the part-time yeti. At least I'm writing something, I guess.

A couple of new crime releases I'm looking forward to (and am lucky enough to be on the blog tours for) this month are <cite>Prey</cite>, by Vanda Symon, and <cite>The Dark Wives</cite>, by Ann Cleeves. Sam Shephard and Vera Stanhope are two of my favourite fictional detectives, for sure.

I've just started <cite>Conquest</cite>, by Nina Allan, as part of my ongoing mission to read everything of hers I can get my hands on. I simply love her writing.
