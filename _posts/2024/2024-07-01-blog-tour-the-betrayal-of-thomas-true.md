In <cite>The Betrayal of Thomas True</cite>, by A.J. West, the wide-eyed eponymous character swaps an unbearable life as a Reverend's son in then-rural Highgate for a new, exciting one in central London.

Apprenticed to his uncle as a chandler, it's not long before Thomas finds a place he can be his real self &ndash; Mother Clap's Molly House in Holborn. There, he receives a cautious welcome, as rumours abound that there's a rat among the mollies, passing their names on to the zealous Society for the Reformation of Manners.

At Mother Clap's, Thomas bonds with Gabriel Griffin, a carpenter by day and molly house guard by night. Having suffered tragic losses in his life, Gabriel is determined to sniff out the rat who's getting his friends killed. But will he solve the mystery in time?

Reading <cite>The Betrayal of Thomas True</cite> is certainly a physically and emotionally immersive experience!

The author describes the (often unpleasant, to say the least) sights and sounds of Georgian London in meticulous detail, and frequently sacrifices or endangers characters you've become attached to.

Fundamentally, with its central question of the Rat's identity and fast-paced, eventful story, this novel is a thriller. But really, it's far too expansive to be contained by any one genre. Historical fiction is the obvious additional category, not only because of the authentic sensory experience mentioned above, but because of the way the author uses real circumstances, locations and events as a springboard, moving things about to suit the story but retaining their essence. There's a bit of fantasy and romance, too.

Similarly, West brings together, and does a great job of balancing, a whole range of tones. There's naturally a lot of dark material, but I also found a great deal to smile or laugh about.

The developing relationship between Gabriel and Thomas is endearing, but not saccharine; the mollies are neither angels nor reprobates, but realistically complex characters; Mother Clap's may be a crude and very "adult" place, but it's a sanctuary, and by no means sordid (unlike, say, the public pilloryings and hangings of its patrons in the name of law and order...); the Justices are figures of ridicule, but also very much to be feared if you're in their sights.

I wasn't far ahead of the protagonists when it came to uncovering the rat's identity, and was usually fooled or stumped when they were, too. Without revealing too much, there's an evergreen message about how amiable, even bumbling fa√ßades can mask hearts of stone.

The ending is emotionally devastating, but, considering all that comes before it, is absolutely the right one for this particular story.

<cite>The Betrayal of Thomas True</cite> is vivid, evocative, and full of twists and turns.
