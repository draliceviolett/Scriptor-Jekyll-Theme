January seemed to go on forever, but I did read 15 books, not least because there were a few days where I didn't feel well enough to do anything more demanding than reading!

Not much happened writing-wise beyond some rough scratchings at writing sessions and workshops (although I did very much enjoy those). It's [Emotional Madness](https://colchesterartscentre.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173640742/events/428571126) next month, so I really need to get a wiggle on.

## Looking ahead...

![Old Babes in the Wood, The Haunted Tea Set & other stories, The Infinite](/images/january-2024-collage-4.jpg)

I'm feeling rather smug because I've already read five of the six books I bought in the Waterstones sale! <cite>Old Babes in the Wood</cite>, by Margaret Atwood, is the sixth.

I love my Mastodon compatriot Sarah Jackson's writing, so of course I jumped at the chance to review her newly-hatched short story collection, <cite>The Haunted Tea Set & other stories</cite>!

I know I said I'd read <cite>The Infinite</cite>, by Ada Hoffmann, last month, but that's because I initially mistook it for the second in the series &ndash; hence, I read <cite>The Fallen</cite> instead. I love how neurodiversity and mental illness are so integral to this imaginative speculative/sci-fi series.
