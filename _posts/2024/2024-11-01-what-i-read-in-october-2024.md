Appropriately, I read 13 books in October, and a not-insignificant proportion of them were spooky in nature. I also saw three Colchester Fringe shows (with three still to see this month), and wrote... not a lot.

![Elemental Forces, Rule Britannia, The Witch's Daughter, And Her Smile Will Untether the Universe, The Keeper](/images/october-2024-collage-1.jpg)

[<cite>Elemental Forces</cite>, edited by Mark Morris](/blog-tour-elemental-forces/) - once again, this annual anthology put me on to new-to-me authors and expanded my TBR exponentially. 4*

<cite>Rule Britannia</cite>, by Daphne Du Maurier - 4*

[<cite>The Witch's Daughter</cite>, by Imogen Edwards-Jones](/blog-tour-the-witchs-daughter/) - 4*

<cite>And Her Smile Will Untether the Universe</cite>, by Gwendolyn Kiste - one of my discoveries from <cite>Elemental Forces</cite>. New obsession alert! 5*

<cite>The Keeper</cite>, by Sarah Langan - another new discovery. 4*

![The Dollmaker, Don't Look Now and other stories, On Beauty, The Invisible Orientation, Babel](/images/october-2024-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>The Dollmaker</cite>, by Nina Allan - 4*

<cite>Don't Look Now and other stories</cite>, by Daphne Du Maurier - aka "assorted British people have some awful travel experiences". 4.5*

[<cite>On Beauty</cite>, by rob mclennan](/on-beauty-by-rob-mclennan/) - 4*

<cite>The Invisible Orientation</cite>, by Julie Sondra Decker - good, but kind of outdated now, and not as fun as Angela Chen and Sheronda J. Brown's books on the subject. 4*

<cite>Babel</cite>, by R.F. Kuang - magnificent. 5*

![Quiet Houses, Victim, The Hotel](/images/october-2024-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>Quiet Houses</cite>, by Simon Kurt Unsworth - 4*

<cite>Victim</cite>, by JÃ¸rn Lier Horst and Thomas Enger, translated by Megan Turney - review coming soon! 4*

<cite>The Hotel</cite>, by Daisy Johnson - small but perfectly formed. 5*

## Looking ahead...

![Pretty Marys All in a Row, Hunting by the River, The Gracekeepers](/images/october-2024-collage-4.jpg)

I'm ridiculously excited to read more of Gwendolyn Kiste's work, and <cite>Pretty Marys All in a Row</cite> is my next stop.

I've had <cite>Hunting by the River</cite>, by Daniel Carpenter, on my radar for a while, and as I received it for my birthday last month it'd be rude to leave it on the pile for long.

I'm already a third of the way through <cite>The Gracekeepers</cite>, by Kirsty Logan &ndash; one of the spoils from my London bookshop raid the other month &ndash; and it's absolutely gorgeous.
