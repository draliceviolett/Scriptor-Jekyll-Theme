March was a long month (one that had me like 'was it really only last month I read that?!' when putting this post together) and, with the exception of Emotional Madness and some damn good reads, not especially exciting or productive. Maybe the arrival of spring will revive my writing mojo?

It felt like I leaned more towards long books, and sci-fi (and long sci-fi books) than usual, but now I look at the month as a whole, I see there's still quite a bit of variety!

![The Blue, One Eye Opened in That Other Place, All the Murmuring Bones, The Dangers of Smoking in Bed, Calendar of Ghosts](/images/march-2024-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>The Blue</cite>, by Nancy Bilyeau - one of the books that had been sitting on my Kindle the longest. 4*

[<cite>One Eye Opened in That Other Place</cite>, by Christi Nogle](/blog-tour-one-eye-opened-in-that-other-place/) - 3.5*

<cite>All the Murmuring Bones</cite>, by A. G. Slatter - 4*

<cite>The Dangers of Smoking in Bed</cite>, by Mariana Enriquez, translated by Megan McDowell - I dread to think what it says about me that I can handle all manner of gruesomeness in books, yet a couple of descriptions of public diarrhoea have me knocking half a star off an otherwise amazing collection. 4.5*

<cite>Calendar of Ghosts</cite>, by Jason Cobley - 4*

![The Collapsing Wave, All Our Hearts Are Ghosts, Mind of My Mind, Clay's Ark, The Grand Illusion](/images/march-2024-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>All Our Hearts Are Ghosts</cite>, by Peter Atkins - 3.5*

<cite>Mind of My Mind</cite>, by Octavia E. Butler - 5*

<cite>Clay's Ark</cite>, by Octavia E. Butler - very rare for me to read two books by the same author back-to-back! 4*

<cite>The Grand Illusion</cite>, by Syd Moore - review coming soon! 4.5*

![The Mars House, Girl Unmasked, The Hunter, The Left Hand of Dog](/images/march-2024-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>The Mars House</cite>, by Natasha Pulley - amazing. I love Pulley's writing so much. 5*

<cite>The Left Hand of Dog</cite>, by Si Clarke - 4*

## Looking ahead...

April is looking relatively quiet for me blog tour-wise, but I am looking forward to reading and sharing my thoughts on Lesley Kara's new novel, <cite>The Other Tenant</cite>.

Other than completing Octavia E. Butler's Patternist series with <cite>Patternmaster</cite>, and having a nose at the award-nominated <cite>Being Ace</cite> anthology, edited by Madeline Dyer, I'm just going to see where the reading mood takes me!
