Once again, I have been busy doing everything (cinema, theatre, writing blogs, reading, and playing many, many board games) except creative writing. Oh well.

<cite>The Japanese Lover</cite>, by Isabel Allende - engaging story, but Seth's refusal to take no for an answer, and some of the (well-meaning) descriptions of East Asian characters were a bit *insert grimace emoji*. 3*

## Looking ahead...

![This Motherless Land, The Great Deceiver, The Book of Secrets](/images/june-2024-collage-4.jpg)

While I'll be largely seeing where my reading mood takes me again, I've just started <cite>The Book of Secrets</cite>, by Anna Mazzola <sup><sub>as it's 99p on Kindle this month</sub></sup> and I love it already.

I'm on the upcoming blog tour for <cite>This Motherless Land</cite>, by Nikki May, and have been admiring the eye-catching cover since I received my copy a couple of weeks ago. I'm sure the contents will be just as stunning.

I've been catching up on my Elly Griffiths reading (each new book she brings out goes around everyone in my house), and <cite>The Great Deceiver</cite> will get me up-to-date... for now.
