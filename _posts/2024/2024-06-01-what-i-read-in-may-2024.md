Still reading, still not writing much other than reviews. It's [Emotional Madness](https://colchesterartscentre.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173640743/events/428571142) next week, and I'm reading an old piece (that will nonetheless be new to most of the audience).

Still, if this creative writing thing totally goes down the pan, maybe I can make a name for myself as someone who's handy to have on a quiz team. Apparently it's *not* common knowledge that Channel 5 started in 1997, or that <cite>Countdown</cite> was the first programme on Channel 4? Shooketh.

## Looking ahead...

As in May, apart from scheduled tours and requested reviews, I'm going to see where the mood takes me this month.

Quite a few of last month's reads were ones that had been on my pile for a while, but I can't say it's got any smaller, because I'm constantly coming across books that sound like exactly my sort of thing!
