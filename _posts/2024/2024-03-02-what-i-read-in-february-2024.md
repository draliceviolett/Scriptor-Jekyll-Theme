At least February went a bit quicker than January did, even with the extra day. I read 13 books, and wrote a piece for [Emotional Madness](https://colchesterartscentre.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173640742/events/428571126) this coming Thursday... not much else to report, really!

As ever, there's loads of books I want to read, and never enough time!

I've previously enjoyed books by [Doug Johnstone](/blog-tour-the-space-between-us/), [Christi Nogle](/blog-tour-promise/), and Syd Moore, so expect I'll be saying good things on the blog tours for their new releases!

<cite>Girl Unmasked</cite>, by Emily Katy, is another review book that looks to be fascinating and validating.

I'm also looking forward to reading more of Octavia E. Butler's work with <cite>Mind Of My Mind</cite>.
