**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

> 'Two years ago, Alexander Blix was the lead investigator in a missing person's case where a young mother, Elisabeth Eie, was kidnapped. The case was never solved.

> 'Blix's career in law enforcement is now over, but Elisabeth's kidnapper is back, leaving evidence of her murder in Blix’s mailbox, as well as hints that there are other victims.

> 'At the same time, Emma Ramm has been contacted by a teenage girl whose stepfather has been arrested on suspicion of killing a childhood friend. But there is no body. Nor are there any other suspects...

> 'Blix and Ramm can rely only on each other, and when Blix’s fingerprints are found on a child’s drawing at a crime scene, the present comes uncomfortably close to the past.

> 'A past where a victim has found their own, shocking form of therapy.

<cite>Victim</cite>, by Jørn Lier Horst and Thomas Enger, picks up shortly after the events of [<cite>Stigma</cite>](/blog-tour-stigma/). Alexander Blix is back home, having had his conviction quashed, but there's no chance of him returning to his career as a police detective.

One criminal doesn't seem to have received this memo, however. The perpetrator of the kidnapping of Elisabeth Eie &ndash; an unsolved case from a couple of years previously &ndash; is sending Blix clues, as well as letters and artefacts that suggest an unsettling familiarity with the former detective's life and routines. Can Blix figure out who they are and what their motivations are before it's too late?

Emma Ramm, meanwhile, is looking into the death of Maria Normann. The police are convinced Maria was murdered by her married boss, with whom she was having an affair, but the man's teenage stepdaughter is sure he's innocent. What exactly happened that day at the hunting and fishing shop by Lake Gjersjørn?

<cite>Victim</cite> is compelling, intriguing, and tense.
