**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for a spotlight post.**

## The book

> '<em>Evil runs deep at Mordenhyrst Hall...</em>

> 'When Grace first sets eyes on the imposing Gothic Mordenhyrst Hall, she is struck with an overwhelming sense that something doesn’t want her there.

> 'Her fiancé’s sister heads a coterie of Bright Young Things whose frivolous
lives hide a sinister intent. Simon, Grace’s fiancé, is not the man she fell in love with, and the local villagers eye her with suspicion that borders on
malevolence.

> 'Her friend, Coralie, possesses the ability to communicate with powerful
spirits. She convinces Grace of her own paranormal gifts – gifts Grace will
need to draw deeply on as the secrets of Mordenhyrst Hall begin to unravel.'

## The author

Cat first started writing when someone thrust a pencil into her hand. Unfortunately, as she could neither read nor write properly at the time, none of her stories actually made much sense.

However, as she grew up, they gradually began to take form and, at the tender age of nine or ten, she sold her dolls’ house and various other toys to buy her first typewriter &ndash; an Empire Smith Corona. She hasn’t stopped bashing away at the keys ever since, although her keyboard of choice now belongs to her laptop.

The need to earn a living led to a varied career in sales, advertising and career guidance, but Cat is now the full-time author of a number of
supernatural, ghostly, haunted house and Gothic horror novels, novellas and
short story collections, including: <cite>Dark Observation</cite>; <cite>The Evil Lurking...In Darkened Hallways</cite>; <cite>In Darkness, Shadows Breathe</cite>; <cite>The Garden of Bewitchment</cite>; <cite>The Haunting of Henderson Close</cite>; <cite>The Darkest Veil</cite>; and <cite>The Malan Witch</cite>.

**<cite>Those Who Dwell in Mordenhyrst Hall</cite> has received fab reviews on the blog tour so far. Why not check out my fellow book bloggers' posts?**
