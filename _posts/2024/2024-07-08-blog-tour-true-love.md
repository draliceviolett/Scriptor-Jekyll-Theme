**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

> 'What does it mean to love and be loved?

> 'It is the 1980s and Finn and Keely are growing up in the North East of England.

> 'Keely is a fighter. Even in the face of loss she strives to seek connection, but finds that sheâ€™s not always searching in the right places.

> 'Finn is quiet, sensitive, distant. He spends much of his time alone, yet deep down he wants to discover the thrill of relating to others.

> 'When the two finally meet, everything is changed. Love &ndash; with all of its attendant joys and costs &ndash; is thrust upon them, and each must decide if they will bend or break under its pressure.

> '<cite>True Love</cite> is a story of the trials of youth, the bonds of family and friendship, and of how much we are willing to risk to have ourselves be seen.'
