August is usually my least favourite month of the year &ndash; it's too hot, and it always feels like everyone's enjoying it except me. But it wasn't so bad this year (despite still being too hot).

As well as reading 14 books, I went to [Norwich GamesCon](https://www.norwichgames.uk/), where I did a bit of shopping *(above &ndash; couldn't resist the "haunted by my TBR" bookmark from [Bookish & Beyond](http://bookishandbeyond.co.uk/)'s stall!)*, played some games, and generally enjoyed being in the city I lived in (but didn't really make the most of) during my undergraduate years.

Not unrelated: I finally cleared out a ton of paper notes from that time, as well as my postgraduate degrees at Essex, and I was struck by how hard I worked, and how interesting some of the material was &ndash; even if I didn't fully appreciate that at the time, either! I've come further than I think.

Writing is still sluggish. I wrote two fragments of stories (one at the WriteNight special at St Osyth Priory *(above)*), both inspired by childhood friends &ndash; I've clearly run out of material from my own life! &ndash; and notes for a silly poem that will never see the light of day, inspired by someone else's poem at [Poetry at Patch](https://www.instagram.com/poetryatevents/), where I am strictly a spectator.

Anyway, books...

<cite>In the Fishbowl, We Bleed</cite>, by Jeremy C. Shipp - objectively good, just not really my sort of horror. 3*

*Why?!*

## Looking ahead...

Quite light on blog tours this month, so hoping (when am I not?) to follow up on authors whose books I've liked, tackle my TBR, maybe even fit in a re-read.

Kate Morton is an author I've kept up with for quite a while, though her books are chunky, so I'd best read her latest, <cite>Homecoming</cite>, while things are relatively quiet! A new Skelfs book from Doug Johnstone is always a good time, and I'm on the blog tour for <cite>Living is a Problem</cite>.

I read <cite>Starling House</cite>, by Alix E. Harrow, a few months ago, and <cite>The Once and Future Witches</cite> sounds perfect for the start of spooky season. I really enjoyed reading my second collection (which had been sitting on my Kindle for a while...) of Daphne Du Maurier's short stories last month, so I want to read another one this month.
