Another 15 books down, and yet my TBR never seems to get any smaller. And another eight reviews. July is looking a bit uneven, with two weeks where I have two posts going out, and a couple where I don't have any pencilled in at all (come on, publishers, respond to my Netgalley requests!).

![The Exphoria Code, Scenes of a Graphic Nature, The Age of Light, The Murder on the Links, The Miseducation of Evie Epworth](/images/june-2020-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>The Exphoria Code</cite>, by Antony Johnston - 4.5*

[<cite>Scenes of a Graphic Nature</cite>, by Caroline O'Donoghue](/scenes-of-a-graphic-nature-by-caroline-o-donoghue/) - 4*

<cite>The Age of Light</cite>, by Whitney Scharer - I'm really into faction (I know, I know) about artists at the moment, and this was absorbing, even intoxicating at times - 5*

<cite>The Murder on the Links</cite>, by Agatha Christie - 4*

[<cite>The Miseducation of Evie Epworth</cite>, by Matson Taylor](/blog-tour-the-miseducation-of-evie-epworth/) - 4.5*

![Expiry Date, A House Through Time, Poirot Investigates, The Golden Notebook, A Cosmology of Monsters](/images/june-2020-collage-2.jpg)

[<cite>Expiry Date</cite>, by Rachel Ward](/expiry-date-by-rachel-ward/) - 3.5*

<cite>A House Through Time</cite>, by David Olusoga & Melanie Backe-Hansen - 4*

<cite>Poirot Investigates</cite>, by Agatha Christie - 5*

<cite>The Golden Notebook</cite>, by Doris Lessing. God, but this was a struggle. I liked the bits in Africa, and when Anna worked for the magazine and the communist publisher. But she is exhaustingly self-absorbed, seems to hate most other women, and constantly palms her kid off on other people so she can gad about. Virtually everyone in the book is awful, and I don't know if it's because a) Anna attracts arseholes, b) Anna sees the worst in everyone, or c) they are just terrible - 3*

[<cite>A Cosmology of Monsters</cite>, by Shaun Hamill](/a-cosmology-of-monsters-by-shaun-hamill) - 4.5*

![The Dutch House, The Collector, Mostly Dead Things, A Biography of Loneliness, Daughters of Fire](/images/june-2020-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>The Dutch House</cite>, by Ann Patchett - 4*

<cite>The Collector</cite>, by John Maher - review coming soon! 4*

[<cite>Mostly Dead Things</cite>, by Kristen Arnett](/mostly-dead-things-by-kristen-arnett) - 4*

<cite>A Biography of Loneliness</cite>, by Fay Bound Alberti - 4*

<cite>Daughters of Fire</cite>, by Barbara Erskine. Published in 2006 and it already feels like completely a different time because the historians in the story are so resistant to involving their own emotions in their writing. Alas, I don't think a barney at a history book launch ever did, or ever will, make the papers, or that we'll get a weekly hour-long TV show where three historians are interviewed about their latest work (if we did, though, it would have to have a better name than <cite>History Discussion Night</cite>...) - 4*

## Looking ahead...

![The Narrow Land, A Dark Matter, An American Marriage, Blood & Sugar, Tennis Lessons](/images/june-2020-collage-4.jpg)

Hoping to use my two (currently) review-free weeks in July to read some books I've been meaning to get to for a while but not had time for. I've had <cite>Blood and Sugar</cite> on my Kindle since the beginning of lockdown, and I received <cite>An American Marriage</cite> in last month's [Books That Matter](https://www.booksthatmatter.co.uk/) box.

I've heard a lot of good things about <cite>A Dark Matter</cite>, while <cite>The Narrow Land</cite> was recently brought to my attention by its Walter Scott Prize win. <cite>Tennis Lessons</cite> just looks right up my street. I'll be reviewing that one for sure as I got it from Netgalley.
