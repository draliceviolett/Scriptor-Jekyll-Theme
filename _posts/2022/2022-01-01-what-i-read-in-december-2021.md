Last month, I read 15 books, which was a normal number for me when my brain was behaving. Yay! Having a decent amount of company holiday over Christmas and New Year helped - I was a bit apprehensive because the quietness and lack of structure in the limbo period is usually bad for me, but this year I actually enjoyed having the time to read and play games.

While I got through quite a few books, I also added a lot to my TBR pile - the Kindle Christmas sale is a dangerous thing!

<cite>An Eye for an Eye</cite>, by Carol Wyer - 3.5*

[<cite>Fall</cite>, by West Camel](/blog-tour-fall/) - 4*

<cite>Three Pianos</cite>, by Andrew McMahon - his songs hit differently now I've read this, and they were already pretty moving. 4.5*

<cite>Darkness Falls</cite>, by Robert Bryndza - not his best alas, there were quite a few careless inconsistencies and historical inaccuracies that took me out of the story. 3*

<cite>The Cleaner</cite>, by Paul Cleave - 4*

## Looking ahead...

OK, so I've already started <cite>The Book of Form and Emptiness</cite>, by Ruth Ozeki, but I'm looking forward to reading the last 90 pages of it (while also not wanting it to end!).

I'm big on folky, uncanny short stories at the moment, so I'm sure <cite>Hag</cite>, edited by Daisy Johnson, will be a treat!

Having (like many, many others) enjoyed Janice Hallett's <cite>The Appeal</cite>, I'm excited to read <cite>The Twyford Code</cite> for the blog tour.

Rebecca Wait's <cite>Our Fathers</cite> is my pick for January's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) (this month's theme is 'a book featuring family'), while <cite>Cemetery Lake</cite> is the next stop of my tour of Paul Cleave's back catalogue.
