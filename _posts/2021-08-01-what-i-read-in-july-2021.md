Another ten books read in another difficult month mentally. Not all the ones I planned, and with a slight theme if you can spot it...

<cite>The Missing Sister</cite>, by Lucinda Riley. Getting to the end of this before finding out her son was going to write the last book was a bit of a 'WHAAAT?' moment! 4*

## Looking ahead...

![Invisible Victim, The Killing Tide, Good Samaritans, 1979](/images/july-2021-collage-3.jpg)

Carrying over Mel Sherratt (though I believe the title has changed!) and Will Carver because I didn't get to them in July. <cite>The Killing Tide</cite> is my first Lin Anderson, for a blog tour, and Val McDermid is one of my 'auto-buy' authors.
