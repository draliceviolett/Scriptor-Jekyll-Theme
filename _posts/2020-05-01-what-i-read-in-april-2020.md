As anticipated, in April I read about the same number of books I normally do, but upped my review game with five new posts, and May is looking good with seven lined up so far (disclaimer: some of these are blog tours/proofs I signed up for before lockdown!). I've been enjoying doing more with my blog, but I do miss my partner and going out to eat.

## Looking ahead...

![Cold Crash, Remain Silent, The Glass House, Injections of Insanity, The Cat and the City](/images/april-2020-collage-4.jpg)

So, I didn't end up reading <cite>The Cat and the City</cite> as I said I would in [last month's round-up](/what-i-read-in-march-2020/) because the publication date changed, so it slipped down my review queue. Unless it changes again, I will definitely read it this month! <cite>The Glass House</cite>, by Eve Chase, is another title I saw on Netgalley and really liked the look of.

I'm looking forward to reading <cite>Cold Crash</cite>, by Jennifer Young, having really enjoyed reading its sequel, <cite>The Running Lie</cite> for an upcoming blog tour. I also have high expectations of <cite>Remain Silent</cite>, by Susie Steiner, because I loved her previous two books, and <cite>Injections of Insanity</cite> will complete my effort to read everything Lorraine Mace has written having been impressed by [<cite>Rage and Retribution</cite>](/blog-tour-rage-and-retribution/) on a blog tour.
