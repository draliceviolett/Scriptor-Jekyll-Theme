I read 17 books in December 2022, which is A LOT, but that's what happens when I get the 'rona and am stuck inside over the Christmas break.

While I was in covid jail, I also finished <cite>Wednesday</cite>, watched the whole new volume of <cite>Unsolved Mysteries</cite> and several episodes of <cite>The Sandman</cite>, and played many, many games of Wingspan on Board Game Arena. Even so, I'm bummed that it's nearly time to get back to work already.

Next Friday (13 January), it's [Emotional Madness with Mary-Ann and Mates at Colchester Arts Centre](https://www.colchesterartscentre.com/events/performance/emotional-madness-with-maryann-mates-1/). If you're local, do come along and hear me read out a short story (provided I've actually written it by then, ahem...)

## Looking ahead...

![Maskerade, The Things That We Lost, The Burning Girls, AHH! That's What I Call Horror!](/images/december-2022-collage-5.jpg)

Now it's January, the blog tour machine is starting back up, and <cite>The Things We Lost</cite>, by Jyoti Patel, looks especially promising.

I'll also be continuing my Terry Pratchett and C. J. Tudor sprees with <cite>Maskerade</cite> and <cite>The Burning Girls</cite>, respectively.

As for <cite>AHH! That's What I Call Horror! An anthology of '90s horror</cite>, edited by Chelsea Pumpkins, well - as if I could resist a short horror story collection with a 90s theme. It's like it was made for me.
