<cite>Wilthaven</cite>, by Oli Jacobs, is a collection of Bureau of Paranormal Discoveries (BPD) reports and found materials relating to the small English town of Wilthaven, also known as P1983 (for reference, our dimension is P0).

Terrorised by an Eldritch Abomination named Hq'tar, it's inadvisable to go out after dark in Wilthaven. It's common for people to disappear, then return as 'avatars' recruiting on the demon's behalf. Despite this, and the absurd geography and weather, the residents try to make the best of things with community events, a local radio station, and a welcoming attitude to newcomers and visitors.

<cite>Wilthaven</cite> is highly creative. The montage format means the author turns his hand to various styles of writing - official reports from BPD agents, autobiography, police reports, newspaper cuttings, transcripts of TV and radio broadcasts, marketing materials, meeting minutes, and more - and does so convincingly and successfully. The many parts hang together well as a cohesive whole and I enjoyed all the different voices and discovering new things about Wilthaven throughout the book.

Something else I appreciated about <cite>Wilthaven</cite> was its thrilling creepiness. Obviously the main premise - Hq'tar and the effects he has on the town - is the prime example, but I also got a shiver down my spine from the ways communications and people slipped between the dimensions, particularly P1983 items that found their way into P0 newspapers and news programmes without the knowledge of editors and producers, crossed phone lines, and unscheduled trains that defied physics and geography.

What's more, <cite>Wilthaven</cite> is very funny. I laughed throughout, but especially at the Wilthaven Walks guide and the extensive list of possible side effects of reading a trans-dimensional book, <cite>The Children of Little Thwopping</cite> (actually another book of Jacobs', which I'm planning to read despite the risk of non-existence, spontaneous arachnid propulsion and runny nose!).

<cite>Wilthaven</cite> is creative, entertaining and delightfully unsettling.
