**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

> 'Copenhagen author Hannah is the darling of the literary community and her novels have achieved massive critical acclaim.

> 'But nobody actually reads them, and frustrated by writer’s block, Hannah has the feeling that she’s doing something wrong.

> 'When she expresses her contempt for genre fiction, Hanna is publicly challenged to write a crime novel in thirty days.

> 'Scared that she will lose face, she accepts, and her editor sends her to Húsafjörður – a quiet, tight-knit village in Iceland, filled with colourful local characters – for inspiration.

> 'But two days after her arrival, the body of a fisherman’s young son is pulled from the water... and what begins as a search for plot material quickly turns into a messy and dangerous investigation that threatens to uncover secrets that put everything at risk... including Hannah.'
