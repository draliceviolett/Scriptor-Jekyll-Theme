May felt really long. Making this list, I couldn't believe I read some of the earlier titles less than a month ago.

Writing-wise, I wrote three stories:

* a 100-word drama in less than a day (that was the time limit)
* a 3,000-word horror comedy (well, it made me laugh, though that may have been hysteria) in two days (it was a ten-day challenge, but I didn't have an idea I liked until day eight)
* a 2,000-word ghost story in seven days (this is as relaxed as my writing practice gets, apparently. And yet I used to be the neurotic, irritating student who always started their essays weeks ahead of the deadline?!).

I also read my work at another successful Emotional Madness with Mary-Ann and Mates. If you live too far from Colchester to experience the shows in person, you can now read some of the talented performers' poetry (and a short story of mine) in the [first Emotional Madness anthology zine](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1470053394/emotional-madness-anthology-1). £5 from each purchase goes to Autism Anglia.

## Looking ahead...

![Voices of the Dead, Thief of Time, Migraine, The Fascination, You Can't See Me](/images/may-2023-collage-4.jpg)

I've already started <cite>The Fascination</cite>, by Essie Fox, and it's amazing so far.

I tend not to go in for many crime/thriller blog tours as I find them quite challenging to review. However, there are a couple of exceptions to my rule: appealing Orenda titles (<cite>You Can't See Me</cite>, by Eva Björg Ægisdóttir), and new books by authors I love (also <cite>You Can't See Me</cite>, and <cite>Voices of the Dead</cite>, by Ambrose Parry). I can't wait to read these!

I'm also planning to continue my Oliver Sacks and Terry Pratchett journeys with <cite>Migraine</cite> and <cite>Thief of Time</cite>.
