In <cite>The Two Lives of Sara</cite>, by Catherine Adel West, we follow the eponymous main character over a couple of years of her life as a young Black woman in early 1960s America.

When we first meet Sara, she's working as a cook in a boarding house in Memphis, where she fled after a dark incident in her home city of Chicago, while she was still pregnant with her baby son Lebanon. The Scarlet Poplar is helmed by Mama Sugar, a no-nonsense matriarch with infinite love to give, and the pair live there alongside Mama Sugar's kindly husband Vanellys, feckless son Amos, bookworm grandson Will, and a collection of permanent and transient boarders.

Having had some horrible experiences in her previous life, Sara is prickly and detached, and believes she is inherently bad and unworthy of love. Her found family in Memphis and blossoming romance with Will's teacher Jonas promise a more positive future, but will her new good fortune hold, and will their support be enough to sustain her if it doesn't?

<cite>The Two Lives of Sara</cite> really put me through it emotionally! I felt so touched by the characters of Mama Sugar, who absolutely radiates love despite the heart-breaking difficulties she's been through herself, and Vanellys, Will, and Jonas, who show their care and consideration for Sara in quieter ways. Together, they work to lower her defences and soften her heart, and she becomes more attentive towards Lebanon and open to ideas about how her life could be.

Sara herself made me feel a variety of emotions throughout the book. I related to her post-traumatic feelings of wretchedness and self-hatred; I loved seeing her start to bloom and come alive to possibilities; there were times where she was frustrating, dislikeable, and disappointing because her experiences had made her a complex, messy, and damaged person. I followed Mama Sugar's example and refused to give up on her, though.

West also expertly massages your emotions by building good things up just to tear them apart. When things look to be going especially well for the characters, she's not afraid to yank the carpet from underneath them with a devastating event, and explore their responses to it. One incident in particular totally broke me and had me wanting to ask her 'how could you?!' - a sure sign that she'd created an absorbing story with characters who felt real.

Due to its context, while <cite>The Two Lives of Sara</cite> is ultimately a story of the everyday lives and loves of a cast of Black characters, the subject of race relations naturally runs through it. Characters refer to the yellow fever epidemic of 1878, which changed the demography of Memphis as white people were both better able to flee the city and more likely to die of the disease; ongoing segregation, formal and informal; racial disparities in public services; contemporary activist campaigns and political calls for equal rights, and more.  

<cite>The Two Lives of Sara</cite> is a masterful story of love and trauma that took me on an emotional rollercoaster.
