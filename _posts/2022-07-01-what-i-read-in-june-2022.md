Now is the summer of our book events. In June, quite aside from reading ten really great books, posting six reviews, and judging my first round of [BBNYA 2022](https://www.bbnya.com) extracts, I attended five: four were part of [Essex Book Festival](https://essexbookfestival.org.uk/) (including one where I read my piece from the [Colchester WriteNight Anthology](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Colchester-WriteNight-Short-Prose-Collection-ebook/dp/B09KZR3QRZ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=colchester+writenight&qid=1638747383&sr=8-1)), and one was at Waterstone's. I also won five books in a [Quick Book Reviews podcast](https://t.co/AKWQhvYvv1) competition!

This month I'm really looking forward to [Primadonna Festival](https://primadonnafestival.com/). These things do tire me out, though, so I've booked a whole week off to prepare for and recover from the weekend! Hopefully I won't spend all that leave sleeping, and will fit in extra reading, a bit of writing, perhaps some board gaming too.

## Looking ahead...

I have so many books to choose from at the moment! My physical TBR is worryingly precarious.

I'm on the blog tour for <cite>Hotbed</cite>, by Joanna Scutts. Which my "erstwhile historian" hat on, it looks super interesting (I should add: I did start <cite>The Ruin of All Witches</cite>, by Malcolm Gaskill, in June as planned! I just finished the month with 80 pages still to read!).

<cite>Eight Detectives</cite>, by Alex Pavesi, is a book I've been meaning to read for ages, and winning it in the competition mentioned above has provided extra motivation.

<cite>How Much of These Hills is Gold</cite>, by C. Pam Zhang, is my pick for July's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) - the theme is "a book with an animal on the cover".

Lesley Kara, author of <cite>The Apartment Upstairs</cite>, is local to me (and her publisher once took us and a bunch of other local booksellers and bloggers out to dinner!), so I always go along to her new book events at Colchester Waterstone's. This time, not only did I buy a copy of the latest title, but got a piece of a yummy cake that looked just like the book.
