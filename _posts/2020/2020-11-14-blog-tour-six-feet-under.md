In <cite>Six Feet Under</cite>, by Colin Garrow, taxi-driving private investigator Terry Bell travels to various locations in the north-east on the trail of a long-hidden secret.

I found the author's descriptions of the different places - from spit-and-sawdust pubs, to open countryside, to the disused bunker where recently deceased builder Ravi and his colleagues were contracted to work for persons and purposes unknown - really vivid and easy to picture in my head.

The idea of a bunker that had been sealed off since the end of World War II really captured my imagination because it was so eerie and provided so much potential for shenanigans. Without giving too much away, the cover-up and long-brewed conspiracy at the heart of the mystery was really interesting, and deeply poignant as well.

I loved the characters of Terry and his romantic partner and colleague Carol. They're down-to-earth, warm and friendly. At the same time, though, they're cynical and shrewd enough to know when they're being spun a line by an interviewee or the police, and refuse to blindly do what they're told. Their relationship is really sweet, and they work well together as a team.

Terry and Carol find themselves in danger at a number of points throughout the story, which really ramps up the suspense, and you really hope they'll come through okay because they're such sympathetic characters.

<cite>Six Feet Under</cite> is a quick, intriguing mystery with warm, down-to-earth characters.
