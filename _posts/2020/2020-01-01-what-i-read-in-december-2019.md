I read 15 books in December, and I'm not surprised - the month seemed to go on forever, and it would have been even more if one of them hadn't been a huge Barbara Erskine tome. I reached a total of 148 books for the year, finishing my last one (<cite>S.T.A.G.S</cite>, by M. A. Bennett) at around 11:15pm on New Year's Eve!

![Grand Union, Nine Elms, How It All Began, Mindf*ck, The Raven King](/images/december-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>Grand Union: stories</cite>, by Zadie Smith. A bit hit-and-miss for me, some of the stories I really enjoyed and others left me cold - 3*

<cite>Nine Elms</cite>, by Robert Bryndza. Robert Bryndza's books are like Pringles - you have one and it leaves you craving more. As I've read all his thrillers now, though, I have to wait ten months for the next one! - 4.5*

<cite>How It All Began</cite>, by Penelope Lively - 4*

<cite>Mindf\*ck: inside Cambridge Analytica's plot to break the world</cite>, by Christopher Wylie. Fascinating, surprisingly wide-ranging re: psychology and culture, and probably not the best choice to read the week of a horrible election result - 4*

<cite>The Raven King</cite>, by Maggie Stiefvater - 4*

![What a Carve Up!, Who Did You Tell?, Joe Country, Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas, Cartes Postales from Greece](/images/december-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>What a Carve Up!</cite>, by Jonathan Coe. Nearly 26 years old, but still so relevant to today that it could have been published last week. Really funny, I absolutely barrelled through it - 5*

[<cite>Who Did You Tell?</cite>, by Lesley Kara](/who-did-you-tell-by-lesley-kara/) - 4*

<cite>Joe Country</cite>, by Mick Herron - 4*

<cite>Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas</cite>, by Adam Kay - 4*

<cite>Cartes Postales from Greece</cite>, by Victoria Hislop. Not quite what I was expecting re: how much we saw of the writer and receiver of the postcards/notebook, but I really enjoyed the short stories - 4*

![The Ghost of Madison Avenue, The Warrior's Princess, I Never Said I Loved You, City of Ghosts, S.T.A.G.S](/images/december-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>The Ghost of Madison Avenue</cite>, by Nancy Bilyeau - 4*

<cite>The Warrior's Princess</cite>, by Barbara Erskine. Similar to <cite>Sleeper's Castle</cite> (or the other way round, as this came out first) in setting and formula, but still a fun read and made me want to go on a holiday to Wales even more - 4*

<cite>I Never Said I Loved You</cite>, by Rhik Samadder. Occasional flashes of humour and relatability (I, too, would be regarded as 'doing well' if only I was a decade younger) but too often felt like a bit of a trudge - 3*

<cite>City of Ghosts</cite>, by Victoria Schwab - 4*

<cite>S.T.A.G.S</cite>, by M. A. Bennett - 4*

## Looking ahead...

![Call Down the Hawk, Those Who Are Loved, Birthdays for the Dead, Ghostland](/images/december-collage-4.jpg)

As ever, this is more of a 'hope to read' than a 'definitely will read' list! Well, I'll definitely be reading <cite>Call Down the Hawk</cite>, by Maggie Stiefvater, because I've already put my bookmark in it ready to begin reading. I found Ronan, his unusual ability, and his family the most fascinating things in the Raven Cycle, so I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.

As a fan of all things spooky, <cite>Ghostland: in search of a haunted country</cite>, by Edward Parnell, looks fascinating to me. Having enjoyed my first Victoria Hislop book last month, I have high hopes for my second, <cite>Those Who Are Loved</cite>. And I've not quite read *everything* Stuart MacBride has ever written, so when I saw <cite>Birthdays for the Dead</cite> in the Kindle sale, I decided it was high time to remedy that! It'll also keep me going until his next new book comes out.
