I read so many good books over this past month! March has a lot to live up to, as February seemed to have a particularly high proportion of books I absolutely inhaled and/or gave 5*.

![Chasing Lions, A Long Petal of the Sea, Unhinged, The Bloody Chamber](/images/february-2022-collage-1.jpg)

[<cite>Chasing Lions</cite>, by Amanda Marks](/blog-tour-chasing-lions/) - 4*

<cite>A Long Petal of the Sea</cite>, by Isabel Allende - I *so* wanted to like this more, but I couldn't connect with the characters and it was more about the historical events than the people. It sounds like this isn't a typical Allende book, so maybe I just chose the wrong one to start with. 3*

[<cite>Unhinged</cite>, by JÃ¸rn Lier Horst and Thomas Enger, translated by Megan Turney](/blog-tour-unhinged/) - 4*

<cite>The Bloody Chamber and other stories</cite>, by Angela Carter - 4*

![Changeling, Deep Down There, The Killing Kind, Good Omens](/images/february-2022-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>Changeling</cite>, by Matt Wesolowski - have I mentioned recently how much I'm loving this series? 5*

[<cite>Deep Down There</cite>, by Oli Jacobs](/blog-tour-deep-down-there/) - 4*

<cite>The Killing Kind</cite>, by Jane Casey - review coming soon! 4.5*

<cite>Good Omens</cite>, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman - my pick for February's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) and WHY did I take so long to get to this? It's brilliant! 5*

![The Midnight Hour, Municipal Gothic, The Porcelain Doll, Galatea](/images/february-2022-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>The Midnight Hour</cite>, by Elly Griffiths - 4.5*

<cite>Municipal Gothic</cite>, by Ray Newman. Carrying on my short story kick! My three favourites in this collection are Modern Buildings in Wessex, Imp Adrift and Director's Cut. 4*

<cite>The Porcelain Doll</cite>, by Kristen Loesch - so compelling and readable that I can't help but forgive the more far-fetched bits (how *do* the same people keep meeting in a country the size of Russia?). 5*

<cite>Galatea</cite>, by Madeline Miller - short and sweet. 4*

## Looking ahead...

![The Flames, The Smallest Man, Beast, Peach Blossom Spring](/images/february-2022-collage-4.jpg)

More great reads ahead as my TBR pile continues to grow! <cite>The Flames</cite>, by Sophie Haydock, and <cite>Peach Blossom Spring</cite>, by Melissa Fu are both blog tour books that look and sound amazing. I'm also looking forward to continuing Matt Wesolowski's excellent Six Stories series with <cite>Beast</cite>.

This month's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) theme is 'Booksta made me do it', which I'm interpreting as 'a popular book that I bought when I repeatedly saw on Twitter that it was 99p': <cite>The Smallest Man</cite>, by Frances Quinn.
