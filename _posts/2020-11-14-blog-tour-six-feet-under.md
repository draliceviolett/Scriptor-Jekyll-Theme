**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [damppebbles](https://damppebbles.com/). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

> "A murder victim, a deserted airfield, a sinister project. Can Terry untangle the mystery before someone else dies?

> "Asked to investigate the death of a building contractor, taxi-driver and amateur sleuth Terry Bell thinks the dead man’s widow may be wasting her money. But when the trail leads to an old airfield and a brace of brutal thugs, he begins to wonder what they’re trying to hide.

> "Tracking down one of the builder’s former workmates, Terry finds him unwilling to answer questions. When the man is beaten up, the canny cabbie gets a visit from his favourite detective inspector. But DI Charis Brown and her latest sidekick seems determined not to get involved. Until the man is attacked again...

> "In this murder/mystery series set on England's northeast coast, <cite>Six Feet Under</cite> is book \#4 in the Terry Bell Mystery series."
