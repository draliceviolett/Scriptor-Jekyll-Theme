I read another 17 books in September, and some of them were amaaazing. And I probably added the same number of books again to my TBR. What can I say? My eyes are bigger than my brain.

## Looking ahead...

![Solutions and Other Problems, The Postscript Murders, The Nesting, Crossbones Yard, The Rain Before It Falls](/images/september-2020-collage-5.jpg)

As ever, lots to look forward to. I'm on the blog tour for <cite>The Nesting</cite> and it looks so good, both in terms of story and cover. A new book from Elly Griffiths is always a treat, and having seen a couple of excerpts, Allie Brosh's new book has shot to the top of my TBR!

I haven't read any Jonathan Coe in a while and I've had <cite>The Rain Before It Falls</cite> on my Kindle for ages, so I'm going to try to get to that. My appetite for Kate Rhodes has well and truly been whetted, so I'm excited to start her Alice Quentin series while waiting for more Scilly Islands books.
