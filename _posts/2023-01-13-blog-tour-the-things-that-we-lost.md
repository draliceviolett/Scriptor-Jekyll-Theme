**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

> 'Nik yearns to know more about his father, who died before he was born. His mother, Avani, held hostage by her guilt surrounding his death, refuses to share any information with her son. Nik is forced to create a fragmented image of his father, pulled together from hushed whispers at family gatherings and photos stolen from his motherâ€™s bedroom.

> 'When his grandfather dies, secrets are revealed, and everything Nik thinks he knows about his father is turned on its head. Nik makes it his mission to discover the truth about his father and the circumstances of his death, uncovering painful truths in the process.'

In <cite>The Things That We Lost</cite>, by Jyoti Patel, we meet 18-year-old Nik and his mother, Avani, in 2017. Both are devastated by the recent death of Avani's father, Rohan, and Nik experiences even more emotional turmoil when he comes into possession of something formerly owned by his own father, Elliot, who died before he was born.

Avani has told Nik very little about Elliot, and isn't happy that he plans to keep what he's inherited. Through Nik's perseverance and flashbacks to key scenes in his and Avani's pasts, we finally get to find out who Elliot was and what happened to him.

I loved <cite>The Things That We Lost</cite> and absolutely inhaled it. It includes so many things I enjoy in a book: experiences of second- and third-generation immigrants, a coming-of-age narrative, a London setting,   

<cite>The Things That We Lost</cite> is an absorbing, warm, and wonderful coming-of-age story.
