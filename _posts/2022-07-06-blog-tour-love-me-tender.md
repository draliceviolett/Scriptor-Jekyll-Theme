In <cite>Love Me Tender</cite>, by Lorraine Mace, DCI Paolo Sterling and his team are under enormous pressure to solve two cases.

A local MP's daughter has died after taking some dodgy drugs, and the detectives are trying to catch the suppliers by staking out The Pipe, a nightclub they've had a tip-off about.

Meanwhile, Sterling makes a tragic and gruesome discovery when he checks on his ex-wife Lydia's colleague, Sasha, who hasn't shown up for work and had recently complained of being followed. Soon afterwards, Sasha's friend Marissa goes missing, and Sterling is worried she'll meet a similar fate, if she hasn't already.

Sterling and his colleagues' attention comes to focus on the patrons of the gym Sasha and Marissa used - but there are a few suspects there to choose from, and is it just a coincidence that some of them have links to The Pipe?

I devoured all the other books in this series two years ago, after reading [<cite>Rage and Retribution</cite>](/blog-tour-rage-and-retribution/) (now retitled <cite>An Eye for an Eye</cite>) for a blog tour, and I'd been meaning to read <cite>Love Me Tender</cite> since it came out 18 months ago.

Not only did it remind me how much I enjoy Mace's books, but I quickly slipped back into the well-realised fictional city of Bradchester, and enjoyed being reunited with the characters: put-upon, conscientious Sterling, perceptive and good-humoured DS Cathy Connors (aka CC), and even conniving DS Jack Cummings.

As in her other books, Mace really keeps you guessing throughout <cite>Love Me Tender</cite>. We know, from a few chapters written from his perspective, that the killer lives comfortably and is romantically attracted to his victims - but that could describe a few of the suspects who come to light.

These chapters are brilliantly creepy, as the author convincingly gets inside the mind of a man who's been warped by a violent upbringing, and thinks he's entitled to women's love and care. I certainly won't look at Love Hearts in the same way for quite a while!

Mace, as ever, tempers her portrayal of the darker side of humanity and nasty crime scenes with flourishes of humour. I particularly enjoyed Sterling and CC's exchanges with Sasha's cantankerous landlady/neighbour and officious letting agent. There's also a rather sweet will they/won't they between Paolo and Lydia, and it's heart-warming to see how well their daughter Katy's doing after some of the things she's been through in previous books.

<cite>Love Me Tender</cite> is a smart, chilling, and brutal crime thriller.
