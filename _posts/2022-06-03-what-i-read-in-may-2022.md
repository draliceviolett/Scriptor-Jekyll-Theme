Having read 11 or 12 books in the first four months of this year, May saw a bit of a dip, as I only read nine - but some of them weren't exactly quick reads, to be fair.

I've also been busy with all sorts, which has been nice, but not so conducive to reading. Hoping to get a head start on my June TBR with the four-day Bank Holiday weekend, though so far I've spent a lot of it scrolling or snoozing.

![Nights at the Circus, A Tidy Ending, Little Drummer, Demon, The Man Who Died](/images/may-2022-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>Nights at the Circus</cite>, by Angela Carter - after a ploddy first third, this story goes batshit insane, and I was very much there for it. 4.5*

<cite>A Tidy Ending</cite>, by Joanna Cannon - I was planning to review this as I got my copy for free for an aborted blog tour, but there's 'an ending that makes you question what's gone before', and then there's 'an ending that makes you wonder if you can trust ANYTHING you've just spent hours reading about, which you really enjoyed'. 3*

<cite>Little Drummer</cite>, by Kjell Ola Dahl - I made it to the end because I wanted to find out whodunit, but this had too much of a 'she breasted boobily' vibe for my taste. 2.5*

<cite>Demon</cite>, by Matt Wesolowski - 5*

<cite>The Man Who Died</cite>, by Antti Tuomainen, translated by David Hackston - this month's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) pick (I can't make the June meeting, bah!). 4*

![The Mayfair Bookshop, Villager, Twenty-Eight Pounds Ten Shillings, Do No Harm](/images/may-2022-collage-2.jpg)

[<cite>The Mayfair Bookshop</cite>, by Eliza Knight](/blog-tour-the-mayfair-bookshop/) - 3.5*

[<cite>Villager</cite>, by Tom Cox](/blog-tour-villager/) - a very welcome reread. 5*, again.

[<cite>Twenty-Eight Pounds Ten Shillings</cite>, by Tony Fairweather](/blog-tour-twenty-eight-pounds-ten-shillings/) - 4*

<cite>Do No Harm</cite>, by Jack Jordan - review coming soon! 4.5*

## Looking ahead...

![No Less the Devil, The Gone and the Forgotten, The Ruin of all Witches, The Locked Room](/images/may-2022-collage-3.jpg)

Having not got to them last month, let's see if I manage to read <cite>No Less the Devil</cite>, by Stuart MacBride, and <cite>The Ruin of All Witches</cite>, by Malcolm Gaskill, this month, shall we?

I'm already partway through and loving <cite>The Locked Room</cite>, by Elly Griffiths - whenever she has a new book out, everyone in my house has a read of it!

I'm on the blog tour for <cite>The Gone and the Forgotten</cite>, by Clare Whitfield, and it sounds intriguing and has a lovely cover.
