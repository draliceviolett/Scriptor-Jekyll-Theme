In August I read nine books, which is unusually low for me. I *want* to read, I have so many books on my Kindle and in my physical pile, but I'm struggling to bridge the gap between intent and action these days.

I do sometimes have a comfort re-read on the go, but I've never thought to include them in my monthly round-up before - maybe I should start (but not now, as I've already made up all the collages). This month I revisited both of Allie Brosh's books, and remembered how her portrayal of depression is SPOT ON.

I think it's a good sign that I'm continuing to blog (though I have eased off on the tours lately), and I'm still able to pick out books I'm looking forward to reading over the month to come. But damn, I feel like part of me's broken off and I would very much like it back please.

[<cite>The Killing Tide</cite>, by Lin Anderson](/blog-tour-the-killing-tide/) - 4*

[<cite>The Handover</cite>, by David M. Barnett](/blog-tour-the-handover/) - simply lovely. 5*

<cite>Late Bloomer: How an autism diagnosis changed my life</cite>, by Clem Bastow - 4*

![Good Samaritans, Ten Days, Mister Impossible](/images/august-2021-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>Good Samaritans</cite>, by Will Carver - 4*

<cite>Ten Days</cite> (formerly <cite>Invisible Victim</cite>), by Mel Sherratt - 4*

<cite>Mister Impossible</cite>, by Maggie Stiefvater - my pick for this month's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) theme, 'a book with more than 300 pages'. Love these books, though this one does have some 'middle book in a trilogy' vibes and I'm already craving the final instalment - 4.5*

![1979, Work in Progress, Letters To My Weird Sisters](/images/august-2021-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>1979</cite>, by Val McDermid - I generally love Val's books, but this one was a little on the dull side I'm afraid. 3.5*

[<cite>Work in Progress</cite>, by Dan Brotzel, Martin Jenkins and Alex Woolf](/blog-tour-work-in-progress/) - 4*

<cite>Letters To My Weird Sisters: On autism and feminism</cite>, by Joanne Limberg - loved how this book is both wide-ranging and highly personal. 5*

## Looking ahead...

![The Heron's Cry, Three Women, The Seven Ages of Death](/images/august-2021-collage-4.jpg)

I'm a big fan of Ann Cleeves so jumped at the chance of being on the blog tour for <cite>The Heron's Cry</cite>. I'm already 200 pages in, and really enjoying it.

Lisa Taddeo's <cite>Three Women</cite> is my pick for September's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) - with a yellow spine, it's the closest book I have to this month's theme of 'a book with a yellow cover'! Shame I read <cite>Good Samaritans</cite> and <cite>Work in Progress</cite> last month, really.

I'm always fascinated to read about forensics and pathology, so I'm glad Richard Shepherd is following up <cite>Unnatural Causes</cite> with <cite>The Seven Ages of Death</cite> this month.
