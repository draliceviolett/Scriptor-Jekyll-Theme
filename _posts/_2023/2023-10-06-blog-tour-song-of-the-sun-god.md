**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

In <cite>Song of the Sun God</cite>, by Shankari Chandran, we follow three generations of a Tamil family from Ceylon (renamed Sri Lanka in 1972), from matriarch and patriarch Nala and Rajan's early lives in 1932, to 2010, by which time they and most of their descendents have migrated to Australia.

In the intervening years, the couple raise three children &ndash; Priya, Nandan, and Dhara (the daughter of Nala's cousin Mohan, lovingly and seamlessly absorbed into the household after her parents become victims of war) &ndash; and become grandparents, then great-grandparents.

The family stay in their homeland for as long as they dare, but eventually the civil war comes too close to home. Only Dhara stays in Sri Lanka, as she feels called to provide medical care to Tamil casualties.

Reading <cite>Song of the Sun God</cite> was such an emotional experience! The author describes whimsical domestic scenes and brutal war crimes &ndash; and everything in between &ndash; with such skill, you can't help but be affected.

I fell in love with all of the principal characters (the story largely focuses on the women's experiences), but especially Rajan and Nala, not only because the novel spans almost their entire lives, but because they're so warm and kind. Their very different personalities complement one another and generate a great deal of humour.

(more stuff I loved about the characters/their interactions)

Embarrassingly, I didn't even know there *was* a civil war in Sri Lanka before I read this book, let alone that it went on for 26 years and ended as recently as 2009.

I remember being taught a fair bit about India in primary school in the 1990s (including the story of Rama and Sita, which is a touchstone for the characters in <cite>Song of the Sun God</cite>), but Sri Lanka was never much more than a name on the maps we coloured in. It was interesting to learn about both the country and the conflict, with many of the war scenes being (necessarily) breath-takingly shocking.

(stuff about the migration experience)

<cite>Song of the Sun God</cite> is a fascinating and tender family saga that's written beautifully and unflinchingly.
