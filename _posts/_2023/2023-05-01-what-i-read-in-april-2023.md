I packed a surprising amount of reading into April - 16 books - though one was a re-skim of a [BBNYA](https://www.bbnya.com/) book I judged in November last year (and therefore wasn't at liberty to say I'd read at the time) for a review.

It helps that I finally replaced my 11-year-old Kindle, which was freezing so often it was unusable. My new one is so whizzy! So I've been playing with my new toy quite a bit.

Writing-wise, I've mostly been carrying on the legacy of the 555 Challenge I did in [March](/what-i-read-in-march-2023/) with lots of micro pieces. As well as writing a 100-word story and a 250-word story for a couple of submissions, I've put together a creative non-fiction collage for the next [Emotional Madness with Mary-Ann and Mates](https://www.colchesterartscentre.com/events/performance/emotional-madness-with-maryann-mates-2/) (16 May!).

<cite>Awakenings</cite>, by Oliver Sacks - 4*

[<cite>Isaac and the Egg</cite>, by Bobby Palmer](/blog-tour-isaac-and-the-egg/) - 5*

<cite>Reach for the Stars: 1996-2006: Fame, Fallout and Pop's Final Party</cite>, by Michael Cragg - did I know most of the information in this book already? Yes. Was it a joy to read nonetheless? Yes! 5*

<cite>White Cat, Black Dog</cite>, by Kelly Link - I *so* wanted to like this more, but too many of the stories went over my head/left me cold. 3*

[<cite>The Arrow Garden</cite>, by Andrew J King](/blog-tour-the-arrow-garden/) - 4*

<cite>The Ringmaster</cite>, by Vanda Symon - good story, but Paul's behaviour towards women hasn't aged too well and gave me the ick. 3.5*

## Looking ahead...

![Hallucinations, Hogfather, Things We Say in the Dark, The Last Remains](/images/april-2023-collage-5.jpg)

This month, I'll be continuing my journey through Oliver Sacks and Terry Pratchett's books with <cite>Hallucinations</cite> and <cite>Hogfather</cite>.

Any new Elly Griffiths book works its way around my whole household, and it'll soon be my turn with <cite>The Last Remains</cite>, the last Dr Ruth Galloway book (for now).

Short stories are never far from my mind, and Kirsty Logan sounds right up my street. I'm starting with <cite>Things We Say in the Dark</cite>.
