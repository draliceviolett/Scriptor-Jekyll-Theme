I read 15 books in August, which I'm pleased with. I made a conscious effort to read some books that have been on my physical and digital TBR piles for a while, and plan to continue this into autumn.

The main things I wrote this month were a micro creative non-fiction patchwork for Emotional Madness, which seemed to go down well, and a 500-word flash story for a challenge.

I find challenges valuable for the impetus to write something that I wouldn't have done otherwise, and for the feedback. Even so, the part of me that craves adulation has an unhelpful tendency to jump to 'ugh, why do I bother?!' when I don't place/win.

I know, deep down, that loads of really talented writers will have entered, and that what I've written just might not "chime" with what the particular judges are looking for, rather than it being objectively bad. No writing is ever truly wasted.

## Looking ahead...

![Promise, The Raging Storm, Breakable Things](/images/august-2023-collage-4.jpg)

As mentioned above, this month I'm going to try to read some more books I've had on the pile for a while. I'm going to see where the mood takes me with those!

But I'll definitely be reading <cite>Promise</cite>, by Christi Nogle, and <cite>The Raging Storm</cite>, by Ann Cleeves (actually, I've already started that one) for blog tours.

Cassandra Khaw has been on my radar for a little while, but her fab contribution to <cite>Do Not Go Quietly</cite> has given me the push to read her latest collection, <cite>Breakable Things</cite>.
