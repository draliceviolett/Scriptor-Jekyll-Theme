I'm not saying that January was a ridiculously long month, but I read 15 books, wrote two short stories (one for a performance, one for a challenge-competition) and a bunch of blog posts, and streamed a bunch of shows.

Can February live up to it? I'm not sure. The trouble with being a) a short story writer, and b) primarily motivated by upcoming performances/competition deadlines is that I tend to crash after each show/completion, and wonder when there's going to be another suitable opportunity/whether I've used up all my ideas.

Anyhow, I have five complete short stories in my repertoire now. One is in the WriteNight anthology; who knows what will become of the other four. Here's what I read when I wasn't writing, watching stuff, playing board games, or doing my actual job.

[<cite>The Things That We Lost</cite>, by Jyoti Patel](/blog-tour-the-things-that-we-lost/) - 5*

<cite>Seven Empty Houses</cite>, by Samanta Schweblin, translated by Megan McDowell - 4*

<cite>Maskerade</cite>, by Terry Pratchett - 4.5*

[<cite>Someone Is Coming</cite>, by T. A. Morgan](/blog-tour-someone-is-coming/) - 4.5*

<cite>The Burning Girls</cite>, by C. J. Tudor - 4*

![Tiding, Bournville, Cold Comfort Farm, Expectant, Greywaren](/images/january-2023-collage-2.jpg)

[<cite>Tiding</cite>, by Si√¢n Collins](/blog-tour-tiding/) - 4.5*

<cite>Bournville</cite>, by Jonathan Coe - highly readable, but I didn't *love* it - 3.5*

<cite>Cold Comfort Farm</cite>, by Stella Gibbons - I wanted to like this more, because so many people seem to really love it, but a lot of the humour went over my head, and it dragged towards the end. It did amuse me when I realised that my mental image of Seth was exactly the same one I get of Nanny Ogg's cat Greebo when he's in human form. 3*

[<cite>Expectant</cite>, by Vanda Symon](/blog-tour-expectant/) - 4*

<cite>Greywaren</cite>, by Maggie Stiefvater - I want to go back and re-read all the Raven Cycle and Dreamer novels again now, but will I ever have time? Probably not. 5*

## Looking ahead...

![Mort, Our Missing Hearts, Mouthful of Birds, Violeta, The Dead of Winter](/images/january-2023-collage-4.jpg)

What do you do when you've read all of the Discworld Witches novels? Move on to Death, of course! <cite>Mort</cite> is a re-read, but the other Death books will all be new to me.

Having started it yesterday, I'm already halfway through <cite>Our Missing Hearts</cite> by Celeste Ng and it's going on my end-of-year list for sure. I'm usually a bit on the fence about speculative/dystopian novels, but what with Ng being one of my favourite authors, I'm loving every minute of this one.

I got a taste of Samanta Schweblin's unsettling short stories last month with <cite>Seven Empty Houses</cite>, and I'm back for more with <cite>Mouthful of Birds</cite>.

I'm also hoping to read <cite>Violeta</cite> by Isabel Allende, having enjoyed one of her books the other month, while Stuart MacBride is an auto-buy for me, mainly because the dark humour in his crime novels is off-the-charts.
