I read 16 books in March, which is a lot, even by my standards! But it was a long month. I've been watching <cite>Unforgotten</cite>, <cite>Line of Duty</cite>, <cite>Back to Life</cite> and <cite>Parks and Recreation</cite> as well as other bits and pieces here and there.

<cite>The Fressingfield Witch</cite>, by Jacqueline Beard - my pick for March's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/). Solid research and storytelling, could have done with additional line editing. 4*

<cite>The Rebuilding of Tom Cooper</cite>, by Spencer Brown - 4.5*

<cite>Confessions of a Forty-Something F##k Up</cite>, by Alexandra Potter - loved it, but had to dock half a point for the suggestion that little free libraries are an adequate substitute for actual libraries. 4.5*

## Looking ahead...

![Your Friend Forever, The Emperor's Babe, Find You First, The Dream Weavers, Things Can Only Get Better](/images/march-2021-collage-5.jpg)

I was very excited this morning to find out that there's a new Barbara Erskine novel, <cite>The Dream Weavers</cite>, out in two weeks! I also saw a tweet about <cite>Things Can Only Get Better</cite>, by David M. Barnett, which sounds right up my street, so I've added to my TBR. I'm on the blog tour for <cite>Your Friend Forever</cite>, by Zena Barrie, and from what I've heard about it so far, I'm going to enjoy it.

<cite>The Emperor's Babe</cite>, by Bernadine Evaristo, is my pick for April's [Book Shelf Raiders](https://www.instagram.com/bookshelfraiders/) - this month's theme is a TBR lucky dip, so I ran a random number generator and this was the result. I loved <cite>Girl, Woman, Other</cite> but didn't like <cite>Blonde Roots</cite> so much, so it could go either way. A copy of Linwood Barclay's latest novel, <cite>Find You First</cite>, has made its way around my family and now it's my turn with it, which I'm very excited about as I love his books.
