I don't think I've read this many five-star reads in the space of a month before - 14 books completed, and seven of them got full marks from me. And I am not one to give five-star ratings out lightly! I very much hope this trend continues into February.

I finished watching <cite>Ghosts</cite> and series one of <cite>Borgen</cite>, binged <cite>It's a Sin</cite> (I kept getting 'something in my eye'), <cite>The Pembrokeshire Murders</cite>, and <cite>The Investigation</cite> (great, but a bit disconcerting to come straight from <cite>Borgen</cite> and see two of its main actors in the first scene!). I also saw <cite>The Dig</cite> and have been keeping up with <cite>WandaVision</cite>. I've rediscovered reflective and creative writing (for good, I hope) and played The Sims 4 A LOT.

[<cite>The Dark Room</cite>, by Sam Blake](/blog-tour-the-dark-room/) - 4*

[<cite>Silent Graves</cite>, by Sally Rigby](/blog-tour-silent-graves/) - 4*

<cite>A Song for the Dying</cite>, by Stuart Macbride - 5*

[<cite>The Boy from Boskovice</cite>, by Vicky Unwin](/blog-tour-the-boy-from-boskovice/) - 4*

<cite>The Coffinmaker's Garden</cite>, by Stuart Macbridge - half a point docked off because I could not for the life of me get my head around the thing with the phone tracing. 4.5*

![Mr Wilder & Me, Exit, The Shape of Darkness, Two Wrongs, Skin](/images/january-2021-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>Mr Wilder & Me</cite>, by Jonathan Coe - a captivating escape from the mundanity of lockdown life. 5*

[<cite>Exit</cite>, by Belinda Bauer](/exit-by-belinda-bauer/) - if I could write like any author, I'd struggle to choose between Bauer, Kate Atkinson and Lissa Evans. Simply brilliant and an early contender for my 'Best of 2021' list. 5*

[<cite>The Shape of Darkness</cite>, by Laura Purcell](/blog-tour-the-shape-of-darkness/) - another title I can't see being dislodged as one of my books of the year. 5*

[<cite>Two Wrongs</cite>, by Rebecca Reid](/blog-tour-two-wrongs/) - 4*

<cite>Skin</cite>, by E. M. Reapy - January's [Books That Matter](https://www.booksthatmatter.co.uk/) pick is full of wisdom and truth, and was exactly what I needed at the time I read it. 5*

![The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and other clinical tales, Fake, The Last Snow, My Dark Vanessa](/images/january-2021-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and other clinical tales</cite>, by Oliver Sacks - my first Oliver Sacks book, and it definitely won't be my last! Humane and witty, but also tragic and moving in places. 5*

<cite>Fake</cite>, by Roz Kay - review coming soon. 4*

<cite>The Last Snow</cite>, by Stina Jackson - review coming soon. 4*

<cite>My Dark Vanessa</cite>, by Kate Elizabeth Russell. A skilful and compassionate telling of a complex and sad story, from the point of view of a very damaged character who is just beginning to discover and address the reality and extent of her inner wreckage - 5*

## Looking ahead...

![The One Hundred Years of Lenni and Margot, She Came to Stay, Psycho-Logical: Why Mental Health Goes Wrong - and How to Make Sense of It, A Beautiful Spy, The Dare](/images/january-2021-collage-4.jpg)

I may have failed to read two of the books I said I would in [December's round-up](/what-i-read-in-december-2020/). I had a very long gap between paydays and decided to read some books I already had instead! I've pre-ordered <cite>Psycho-Logical: Why Mental Health Goes Wrong - and How to Make Sense of It</cite>, by Dean Burnett, as I've enjoyed his other books and I'm finding that when it comes to mental health, knowledge is power.

I'll definitely be reading <cite>The One Hundred Years of Lenni and Margot</cite>, by Marianne Cronin, <cite>She Came to Stay</cite>, by Eleni Kyriacou, <cite>A Beautiful Spy</cite>, by Rachel Hore, and <cite>The Dare</cite>, by Lesley Kara, because I'm on the blog tours for them and they look particularly exciting!

Alas, this will be the first time I don't get to see Lesley promoting her new book in person. I met her at Colchester Waterstones when <cite>The Rumour</cite> came out, then her publishers treated a group of us local book bloggers to a fancy meal to launch [<cite>Who Did You Tell?</cite>](/who-did-you-tell-by-lesley-kara/), and I saw her at Waterstones again when it was published, which was one of my last engagements in The Before Times.

But there are upsides to everything moving online - next month I'm going to see [Elly Griffiths](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/whats-on/live-author-event-with-elly-griffiths) and [Nicci French](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/whats-on/live-author-event-with-nicci-french) as part of the [Suffolk Libraries Day Book Festival](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/whats-on/festival/sld) - whereas previously I've always missed them due to time or location.
