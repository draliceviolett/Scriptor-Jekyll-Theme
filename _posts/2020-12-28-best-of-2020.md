Three days left of 2020. I know dates are just numbers and everything isn't magically going to get better at midnight on 1 January 2021 (some things are definitely getting worse, in fact), but I'm still happy to see the back of this year and hoping for better days ahead. I want to see my friends, do different things, and start going out to work again.

I've been lucky in that I've been able to work from home - in an exciting new job, no less! - and stay safe. Faced with more free time at home, I took the opportunity to read more and post a lot more reviews on my blog. Something from 2020 I am looking forward to taking into the new year is continuing to take part in blog tours - I've read so many great books I might not have done otherwise, for free, and I love feeling like I've helped authors.

I haven't just been reading more, though. I've listened to much more music than usual to replace the buzz of the office - [visit my Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/shes_on_fire) to see who's provided the soundtrack of my life this year.

I've also been watching more. I've binged new series such as <cite>The Babysitters Club</cite>, <cite>Unbelievable</cite>, <cite>Ratched</cite> and <cite>Unsolved Mysteries</cite> on Netflix, and Amazon Prime's adaptation of Celeste Ng's excellent <cite>Little Fires Everywhere</cite>. I've also belatedly developed an addiction to crime dramas such as <cite>Happy Valley</cite>, <cite>Line of Duty</cite>, <cite>Unforgotten</cite>, <cite>Cardinal</cite> and <cite>The Bridge</cite> (I love Saga so much). I'm currently working my way through <cite>Borgen</cite> and looking forward to discovering more Nordic shows several years after everyone else!

And so, to books! I managed to whittle everything I read this year (Goodreads says I've read over 200 books, but some are duplicates - I think it's more like 180-190, which is still quite ridiculous) down to ten 2020 releases across three categories, as well as a handful of earlier publications that I read this year and warrant a mention. So, without further ado...

## Fiction

![The Mercies, Sisters, The Glass House, Away with the Penguins](/images/best-of-2020-fiction.jpg)

**<cite>The Mercies</cite>, by Kiran Millwood Hargrave** is set in seventeenth-century Norway and based on real events. After a fishing village's able-bodied men are all lost to the sea during a storm, the women take over their roles in order to survive - but still can't escape patriarchal attitudes. Vivid and absorbing, I couldn't get enough of this book.

**<cite>Sisters</cite>, by Daisy Johnson** is about a pair of teenage sisters who move to a house by the sea with their mother after an incident. That's all I can give away about the plot, but I can say it's lyrical, brutal and devastating and I devoured it in a single sitting.

**[<cite>The Glass House</cite>, by Eve Chase](/the-glass-house-by-eve-chase/)** features decades-old mysteries, family secrets, a sprawling country house, a dual timeline, rich descriptions and lots of twists - all things I love.

**<cite>Away with the Penguins</cite>, by Hazel Prior** is about a grumpy old woman who decides to impose herself on three penguinologists working on an island off Argentina, with surprisingly positive outcomes. Life-affirming and uplifting without being saccharine.

## Crime fiction

![Cry Baby, The Darkest Evening, Still Life](/images/best-of-2020-crime.jpg)

These novels from three of my favourite authors all feature characters I love, intriguing plots, and fantastic worldbuilding.

**<cite>Cry Baby</cite>, by Mark Billingham** takes us back to Tom Thorne's first big case, in 1996. I especially loved the 90s details and watching Tom meet pathologist Phil Hendricks for the first time!

**<cite>The Darkest Evening</cite>, by Ann Cleeves** is a welcome return to the world of Vera Stanhope (maybe in 2021 I'll actually watch the TV series!). I adored the country house setting and the interactions between practical, dowdy Vera and her very refined relatives.

**<cite>Still Life</cite>, by Val McDermid** sees Karen Pirie take on another two mysterious murders. I always love how McDermid uses forensics in her books, and the complexity of the cases and race against time really made me sit up and pay attention too.

## Non-fiction

![Dear Reader, The Address Book, Solutions and Other Problems](/images/best-of-2020-non-fiction.jpg)

**[<cite>Dear Reader</cite>, by Cathy Rentzenbrink](/dear-reader-by-cathy-rentzenbrink/)** is a heartwarming love letter to books that made me think about the books that have shaped my own life.

**[<cite>The Address Book</cite>, by Deirdre Mask](/the-address-book-by-deirdre-mask/)** is a fascinating account of why and how we name our streets which brought my attention to things I'd never even considered before.

**<cite>Solutions and Other Problems</cite>, by Allie Brosh** is a new collection of relatable and zany comic stories from the creator of Hyperbole and a Half. I laughed, I cried, I marvelled at how she creates such consistently good artwork in Microsoft Paint.

## Honourable mentions

![The Eighth Life, All Change, The Stone Diaries, A Dark Matter, Your Fault](/images/best-of-2020-honourable-mentions.jpg)

These are the books I read this year that weren't published in 2020, but I couldn't not mention! **<cite>The Eighth Life</cite>, by Nino Haratischvili**, is a 1000+ page generation-spanning epic that I nonetheless devoured in a matter of days! **<cite>Your Fault</cite>, by Andrew Cowan** was another 2019 release that stood out for me - you don't get many books set in New Towns (and I've always kind of wanted to write one), and this one features a heartbreaking story and brilliant 1960s details.

I read most of **Elizabeth Jane Howard**'s Cazalet Chronicles this year, and really need to get round to reading her other books as they're so good. I also need to read more **Carol Shields**, having picked up [<cite>The Stone Diaries</cite>](/blog-tour-the-stone-diaries/) for a blog tour and absolutely loved it. This was also the year I discovered **Doug Johnstone**, starting with the sublime <cite>A Dark Matter</cite> and going on to several of his other books.

So that's my round-up of 2020 - I'll be back on New Year's Day with my December round-up, and I've got lots of review stops in the diary for January too!
