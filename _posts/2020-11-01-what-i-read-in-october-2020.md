I read 16 books in October. Alas, two of the books I said I would read in [last month's post](/what-i-read-in-september-2020/) weren't among them! I had quite a few library books I had to get through before they expired, as well as three blog tours in one week, so naturally those took priority. But November is another month!

<cite>It Takes Blood and Guts</cite>, by Skin with Lucy O'Brien - so interesting to read the stories behind the songs, and how this icon got where she is. 5*

![Seven Kinds of People You Find in Bookshops, The Coral Bride, The Lying Life of Adults, Murder under the Microscope](/images/october-2020-collage-4.jpg)

<cite>Seven Kinds of People You Find in Bookshops</cite>, by Shaun Bythell - review coming soon! 4.5*

<cite>The Coral Bride</cite>, by Roxanne Bouchard, translated by David Warriner - review coming soon! 4.5*

<cite>The Lying Life of Adults</cite>, by Elena Ferrante - I actually liked this better than the Neapolitan books, because it focuses on a short period in adolescence rather than taking a broad view of the character's whole life. 4*

<cite>Murder under the Microscope</cite>, by Jim Fraser - quite interesting, but I've read more engaging books on the subject. 3.5*

## Looking ahead...

![The Haunting of Alma Fielding, The Searcher The Rain Before It Falls, Crossbones Yard](/images/october-2020-collage-5.jpg)

Maybe if I name four, rather than five books, and include the two I meant to read in October, I'll have more chance of achieving my goal? Anyway, <cite>The Haunting of Alma Fielding</cite> by Kate Summerscale looks AMAZING and perfect for spooky season, and I always love me a bit of Tana French.
