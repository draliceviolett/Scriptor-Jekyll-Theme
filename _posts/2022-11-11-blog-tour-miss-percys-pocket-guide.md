> 'Miss Mildred Percy inherits a dragon.

> 'Ah, but we’ve already got ahead of ourselves...

> 'Miss Mildred Percy is a spinster. She does not dance, she has long stopped dreaming, and she certainly does not have adventures. That is, until her great uncle has the audacity to leave her an inheritance, one that includes a dragon’s egg.

> 'The egg - as eggs are wont to do - decides to hatch, and Miss Mildred Percy is suddenly thrust out of the role of “spinster and general wallflower” and into the unprecedented position of “spinster and keeper of dragons.”

> 'But England has not seen a dragon since... well, ever. And now Mildred must contend with raising a dragon (that should not exist), kindling a romance (with a humble vicar), and embarking on an adventure she never thought could be hers for the taking.'

## The author

<img src="/images/quenby-olson-200.jpg" alt="Quenby Olson" style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">

Quenby Olson lives in Central Pennsylvania where she spends most of her time writing, glaring at baskets of unfolded laundry, and chasing the cat off the kitchen counters.

She lives with her husband and children, who do nothing to dampen her love of classical ballet, geeky crochet, and staying up late to watch old episodes of <cite>Doctor Who</cite>.

<cite>Miss Percy's Pocket Guide to the Care and Feeding of British Dragons</cite> is another BBNYA semi-finalist I enjoyed reading an excerpt from. I'd like to read the whole book sometime, as I'm sure it continues in the same charming, quirky, and original vein.
