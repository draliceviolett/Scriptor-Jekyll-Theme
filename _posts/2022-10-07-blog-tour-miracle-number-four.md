**This post is part of a blog tour organised by [Random Things Blog Tours](http://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox.blogspot.com/p/services-to-publishers-authors-blog.html). I received a free copy of the book in return for an honest review.**

> '1976: With dreams of a career in rock, a crush on the prettiest girl in town, and a mother in remission from cancer, Mikeâ€™s future looks bright.

> 'Music brings excitement and a chance to shine, but life off-stage is complicated. Together with family, friends and band-mates, Mike finds joy, sadness and loss. Troubling secrets surface while a new friend brings both fresh perspectives and a cruel reality.

> 'The radios and pubs blast rock into the suburban nights and the band prepare for their big break. Is Mike
ready?'
