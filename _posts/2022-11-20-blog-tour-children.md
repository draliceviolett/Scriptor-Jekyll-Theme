> 'Gods make lousy parents.

> 'All Magni wants is peace and quiet, but when your father is the God of thunder, you don’t get to live the life you want.

> 'When Thor destroys all his son knows and loves, Magni vows to bring prosperity and end the violence... forever. But can you escape cruelty in a universe built on it, or the shadow of your father when everyone calls you by his name?

> 'Maya, her rage more powerful than she knows, wants freedom to pursue her own destiny. Neither torture nor blackmail can make her obedient or pretty enough for Freya, her foster-mother and Goddess of love.

> 'Fighting for independence and revenge, can a mere human win a game where Gods dictate the rules?

> 'The book includes strong language, depictions of sexual, physical, and emotional violence. [View a full list of triggers, which may contain spoilers](https://www.bjornlarssen.com/children-tw/).'

## The author

<img src="/images/bjorn-larssen-200.jpg" alt="Bjørn Larssen" style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">

Bjørn Larssen is a Norse heathen made in Poland, but mostly located in a Dutch suburb, except for his heart which he lost in Iceland.

Born in 1977, he self-published his first graphic novel at the age of seven in a limited edition of one, following this achievement several decades later with his first book containing multiple sentences and winning awards he didn’t design himself.

His writing is described as ‘dark’ and ‘literary’, but he remains incapable of taking anything seriously for more than 60 seconds.

Bjørn has a degree in mathematics and has worked as a graphic designer, a model, a bartender, and a blacksmith (not all at the same time). His hobbies include sitting by open fires, dressing like an extra from <cite>Vikings</cite>, installing operating systems, and dreaming about living in a log cabin in the north of Iceland.

<cite>Children</cite> is another BBNYA semi-finalist I've added to my TBR list. I love books that draw on myths and their characters, and this one promises excitement and humour too!
